<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“THE ONLY AMERICAN IN HAVANA.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>A boy of some eighteen or nineteen
years rushed frantically out upon a wharf
bordering the harbor of Havana.</p>

<p>“Hold on!”</p>

<p>Elbowing his way through the dark-skinned
crowd, he reached the string-piece,
now waving his arms wildly.</p>

<p>At the top of his voice came the fervent
appeal:</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me behind!”</p>

<p>Unheedful of the Spanish crowd about
him, the boy gazed anxiously at the fast
receding stern of the United States
steamer Fern.</p>

<p>That crowd was bent on mischief. It
had jeered itself nearly hoarse when the
little steamer left her berth.</p>

<p>Now it saw in this shouting, gesticulating
youth a closer victim of their
sport.</p>

<p>“Swim!” jeered one low-browed,
dirty Spaniard.</p>

<p>To this came an echoing shout of:</p>

<p>“Make him swim!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Throw the Yankee dog into the
harbor. He will find company in the
sailors of the Maine!”</p>

<p>A yell went up&mdash;a yell that was partly
derisive and partly defiant.</p>

<p>It had one effect that the victim was
quick to notice&mdash;it utterly drowned out
his appealing shouts to those on the deck
of the Fern, causing him to gasp:</p>

<p>“Am I the only American left behind
in Havana?”</p>

<p>It looked like it.</p>

<p>Further from the pier, nearer every
moment to the entrance of Havana harbor
went the Fern, the last of the United
States steamers to leave Cuba’s capital
city on that memorable afternoon of the
ninth of April, 1898.</p>

<p>Aboard the Fern was that sturdy
American hero, General Fitzhugh Lee.</p>

<p>Up to the last moment he had served
the interests of the United States and her
citizens as consul general at Havana.</p>

<p>Now, when the state of affairs there
had become intolerable, General Lee had
sailed on the Fern.</p>

<p>After indomitable efforts extending
over several days, he had succeeded in
shipping, as he believed, the last American
in that danger-infested city.</p>

<p>Then, and not until then, had General
Lee stepped aboard the Fern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[2]</span></p>

<p>His coming had been the signal for the
start. A moment later the little steamer’s
prow was cutting the muddy, blood-stained
waters of Havana harbor.</p>

<p>Close to the wreck of the United States’
once proud battleship Maine passed the
Fern.</p>

<p>Standing on deck, General Lee and his
immediate party had bared their heads in
silent respect and grief for the two hundred
and sixty-six sailors whom Spanish
treachery had destroyed.</p>

<p>General Lee believed that he had succeeded
in bringing the last American
away.</p>

<p>He certainly had, so far as he knew.
He had done his duty like an American.</p>

<p>Yet, all unknown to him, one American
remained behind&mdash;Hal Maynard, the
boy who now stood watching the receding
Fern with a look of mingled anxiety and
wistfulness.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hal uncovered. His glance
had rested on the Stars and Stripes at the
steamer’s stern.</p>

<p>It was a courageous thing to do&mdash;to
salute the hated Yankee flag in this
stronghold of that flag’s bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>But Hal did it, without bluster or hesitation.</p>

<p>There was a choking sensation in the
boy’s throat; tears glistened in his eyes.</p>

<p>“My country’s flag,” he murmured
brokenly. “May God always bless your
folds, and protect them! May those Stars
and Stripes soon come back here, and
float a supreme warning that treachery
and tyranny can never flourish in the
New World!”</p>

<p>It may be that some of the Spaniards
grouped about him heard him. If so,
they did not understand, or it would have
been worse for this American boy.</p>

<p>“The senor does not like our climate!”</p>

<p>Jeeringly the words were uttered.</p>

<p>Half turning, Maynard gazed unto the
speaker’s eyes.</p>

<p>The latter was a Spaniard, a peon or
laborer. Ragged, barefooted, dirty, he
had the appearance of a man half-starved.</p>

<p>The fellow’s tattered sombrero rested at
an angle on his head. His gleaming,
glittering eyes, made brighter by that
nondescript illness, slow starvation, had
an ugly light in them.</p>

<p>In whatever direction Maynard turned
he saw others like this fellow&mdash;thousands
of them.</p>

<p>Every wharf and pier, every building
near the water front, every available spot
of view was crowded by Spaniards who
had come out to watch the departure of
America’s consul general, and, watching,
to jeer.</p>

<p>It was no use to gaze longer after the
Fern, yet Hal Maynard found himself
unable to stir.</p>

<p>“If I never see the flag again, I must
see it to the last to-day,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Senor does not like our climate?”
again jeered the fellow at his elbow.</p>

<p>Hal made no answer, not even turning
this time.</p>

<p>But his tormentor would not quit.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is our people that the
senor does not like? I have heard that
there were some Americans who do not
love the Spanish!”</p>

<p>Still Hal stood with his eyes fastened
on the flag.</p>

<p>“If the senor is a good friend of
Spain,” continued the fellow, with mocking
insinuation, “he will shout, ‘viva
Espana!’”</p>

<p>Long live Spain? Hal Maynard would
have died a dozen deaths sooner than
utter such a detestable wish!</p>

<p>Those black, gleaming eyes were
fastened on him pitilessly, until&mdash;until
the tormentor found himself ignored.</p>

<p>Then he swiftly turned to his fellow
Spaniards.</p>

<p>“Here is an American!” he cried.</p>

<p>A laughing chorus greeted the announcement.</p>

<p>“He wanted to go home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>More laughter greeted this stupid sally.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued the announcer,
“he is crying to find himself left here
with us!”</p>

<p>“There is yet time for him to swim
after the vessel!” jibed another Spaniard.</p>

<p>“Or let him cruise home on the
Maine!”</p>

<p>At this there was a cyclonic burst of
laughter.</p>

<p>Instantly the other Spaniards began to
cast about for sayings which the crowd
would regard as being witty.</p>

<p>Hal Maynard’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>A fight would be helpless&mdash;hopeless,
leaving him only the fate of death at the
hands of this jibing, vicious mob.</p>

<p>Yet no sooner was the word “Maine”
uttered than he turned once more to
where the wreck of the Maine lay and
lifted his hat with a motion of reverence.</p>

<p>It was grit&mdash;clear grit! That much
even the Spaniards could appreciate.</p>

<p>It was a defiance, too, and in a moment
angry murmurs went up.</p>

<p>“Let us see if a Yankee pig can swim!”</p>

<p>“And if he steers toward that battered
iron scow, we can shoot him from the
wharf.”</p>

<p>“As we will shoot all Yankees who
dare to come here after this!” shouted
another.</p>

<p>Hal faced them, head erect and shoulders
thrown back.</p>

<p>He fully expected to be thrown into
the muddy water, but he did not propose
to flinch.</p>

<p>For a moment the crowd hesitated,
ready to follow any caprice, but waiting
for a leader.</p>

<p>After waiting a moment for the attack,
Hal felt a sudden thrill of misgiving.</p>

<p>His hand had touched, accidentally,
on something under his coat.</p>

<p>That recalled him to his duty, to the
reason for his being in Havana, to the
cause of his being left behind.</p>

<p>Hidden away in his clothing was a
bag. It contained two thousand dollars,
the property of another, confided to his
care.</p>

<p>“This mob is made up of worthless
fellows,” muttered the boy. “They don’t
know any better than to do as they are
doing. They are so ignorant that not one
in a dozen of them would know his own
name in print. They shall not make me
forget my duty. Since there is no American
ship here, I will try to find an English
one.”</p>

<p>Then, ignoring the crowd that surged
about him, he turned again to scan the
line of wharves.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile away lay
a brig from whose masthead floated the
Union Jack of Great Britain.</p>

<p>“I shall be safe there,” murmured
Hal. “I can leave Havana on that
craft. It may even be that the brig is
bound for an American port.”</p>

<p>His mind made up, he turned to leave
the wharf, meaning to walk along the
river front until he came to the brig’s
wharf.</p>

<p>But his original tormentor put himself
fairly in the boy’s path.</p>

<p>“Where is the Yankee pig going to
root?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Other murmurs went up.</p>

<p>“Do not let him leave us!”</p>

<p>“Not until he has cried ‘viva Espana!’”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Hal, trying to
speak calmly, “I find that I am not on
the right wharf. Will you allow me to
pass?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, senor!”</p>

<p>“Way for the gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Let the Yankee pig find his wallow!”</p>

<p>Click-clack! click-clack! Way on the
outskirts of the crowd a man had picked
up a cobblestone, on which he now began
to whet his knife.</p>

<p>It was a most suggestive sound. The
crowd roared with merriment, craning<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
their necks to see whether this Yankee
blanched.</p>

<p>But Hal, though he knew that a spark
would be sufficient to touch off a mine of
Spanish mob-treachery, retained his composure.</p>

<p>“I am in a hurry, if you please,” he
said, trying to edge his way through.</p>

<p>The crowd pretended to make way, yet
each Spaniard took pains to get only
more in the way.</p>

<p>They were playing with him, as a cat
does with a mouse, enjoying their sport
with true feline ferocity.</p>

<p>One of the crowd suddenly divined our
hero’s purpose.</p>

<p>“He wants to reach that English ship.
The gringo fancies he will be safer there
than with us. Let us convince him that
our hospitality is genuine.”</p>

<p>Still laughing, the crowd made way for
Hal to pass off the pier, but the instant
that he tried to walk along the shore in
the direction of the bridge, he found
himself confronted by the dense ranks of
a barring crowd.</p>

<p>“No, no, senor! Straight back into
Havana.”</p>

<p>“I guess I might as well go to a
hotel,” Hal acquiesced, inwardly. “From
there, an hour later, I may be able to get
a closed carriage to the brig.”</p>

<p>There was a driver within call. To him
Hal signaled.</p>

<p>The jehu came up, but on hearing the
name of the hotel, he shook his head and
scowled.</p>

<p>“No, no, senor,” he protested, “I cannot
drive Yankees.”</p>

<p>“I will walk, then,” rejoined Hal.</p>

<p>But the crowd protested that he must
ride.</p>

<p>“If the senor will pay three fares,”
declared the jehu, “I will take him.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” muttered Hal, stepping
into the carriage.</p>

<p>“Ha! Senor Maynard, wait! I must
see you!” cried a man, making his way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Vasquez!” thrilled the boy, recognizing
his accoster.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time that day, Hal
Maynard turned pale.</p>

</div>


<p>Senor Vasquez, a middle-aged Spaniard
with the air of a prosperous merchant,
pushed his way through to the carriage.</p>

<p>The crowd, scenting as if by instinct
some new trouble for the boy, made way
for the newcomer.</p>

<p>Vasquez’s eyes glittered. He regarded
the boy with a look of evil triumph,
though his manner, as he stepped into
the carriage, was faultlessly diplomatic.</p>

<p>“You will excuse my intrusion?” he
begged.</p>

<p>“I shall have to,” was Hal’s cold rejoinder.</p>

<p>“I was anxious to see you. This meeting
has given me great pleasure.”</p>

<p>Then, lowering his voice, he added:</p>

<p>“Senor Maynard, your employer owes
me, as you know, two thousand dollars.
I must have that money at once.”</p>

<p>“If Mr. Richardson owes you anything,”
replied Hal, “he will pay it.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Do you think I am so simple?
Senor Richardson left yesterday for Key
West.”</p>

<p>“I repeat,” came firmly from Hal,
“that, if he owes you anything he will
pay it.”</p>

<p>“And I, my dear young friend,” rejoined
the Spaniard, “assure you that I
mean to collect from you. You have the
money. I know it.”</p>

<p>Hal tried not to start at this cool piece
of assurance.</p>

<p>“I know,” continued Senor Vasquez,
in the same low tone, “where you collected
the money. I know just how much
you collected, and can tell you, to a<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
peseta, just how much you carry in a certain
bag. Ha! my friend, you do not
seem happy over my knowledge. But a
trustworthy man of mine has followed
you. You see that there is no use denying
what my faithful agent told me.”</p>

<p>“But did he tell you,” smiled Hal,
coolly, “where I took that bag?”</p>

<p>Senor Vasquez changed color and hesitated.</p>

<p>That was enough to show observant
Hal that his “bluff” had a chance of
winning.</p>

<p>“If he did not tell you that,” resumed
the American, “go back and cane your
agent for a sleepy fellow. Senor Vasquez,
if you meant to wrest the money from me
by force, you should have employed a
better agent.”</p>

<p>Maynard’s manner was so cool and convincing
that for a moment the Spaniard
was staggered.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he cried, suddenly. “Whatever
you have done with the money, you have
not had chance to send it out of Cuba,
and your last chance to do that is gone.
Perhaps you will conclude to tell me
where the money is.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly not,” rejoined Hal, stoutly.</p>

<p>“Now, if I were to make a few remarks
about you to the crowd which
surges about this carriage, do you know
what would happen to you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Hal. “I should
be in danger of being killed.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel like taking the risk?”</p>

<p>“If you were scoundrel enough, senor,
I should be compelled to take it.”</p>

<p>Vasquez’s black eyes snapped dangerously.</p>

<p>“I have only to say the word,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>Hal was playing a desperate game.
The thought drove some of the color from
his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me where the money
is?” insisted the Spaniard.</p>

<p>“Suppose that I did not know, how
could I tell you?”</p>

<p>Vasquez snorted impatiently, then
beckoned to one of the leaders of the
mob, who quickly approached.</p>

<p>“Your last chance, Senor Maynard,”
whispered the Spaniard.</p>

<p>“I can tell you nothing.”</p>

<p>As Hal uttered these words he expected
to be handed over to the Spanish mob.</p>

<p>To his surprise Vasquez’s manner swiftly
changed.</p>

<p>To the ring-leader Senor Vasquez said:</p>

<p>“Pedro, I trust that your friends will
not molest this young man. He is in a
measure under my protection.”</p>

<p>“Senor Vasquez’s words always carry
weight,” was the quick, respectful
answer.</p>

<p>“My dear young friend,” went on the
Spaniard, “I may see you again. If we
do meet, I trust I shall find you more
gracious.”</p>

<p>With that the Spaniard slipped quickly
from the carriage, and the driver, taking
the cue, turned up one of the streets into
the city.</p>

<p>Jeers followed, but nothing else happened.</p>

<p>“Vasquez is as slick as ever,” mused
Hal, sinking back on the cushion. “At
first, he thought he would frighten me.
Now perhaps he means to call upon me
at the hotel, try to convince me that he
saved my life, and thus work upon my
gratitude. If Senor Vasquez imagines that
he can persuade me to betray my good
old employer, he will wake up and find it
all a dream!</p>

<p>“But first of all he will send his agents
out again, to see if he can get them on
the track of the place where the money
is. How my Spanish pirate would swear
if he knew that he had been within a foot
of the money all the while! Yet, because
I have fooled the fellow this time, I must
not underrate him. He is deadly!”</p>

<p>Deadly, indeed! Vasquez, though a<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
rich merchant, had seldom earned an
honest dollar.</p>

<p>He belonged to a Spanish type that has
been common in Cuba. American merchants
and planters, especially those who
were new to the island, had been his
especial game for years.</p>

<p>He sought the acquaintance of such
“new” Americans, tendered them his
services and goods, and charged exorbitantly
for both.</p>

<p>Should an American planter protest,
the crop in one of his sugar or tobacco
fields was burned, nor was it long before
the planter learned that “irrepressible
friends of Senor Vasquez had rebuked a
grasping foreigner.”</p>

<p>Should an American merchant protest
at Vasquez’s charges, something happened
to the “impudent merchant’s”
stores or warehouses.</p>

<p>Yet Vasquez himself had always kept
on the safe side of the law, while cheerfully
ruining Americans.</p>

<p>They were simply compelled to submit
to his extortions. One American, a
planter, who had resolutely resisted the
Spaniard, had been found dead, but the
crime could be fastened on no one.</p>

<p>Just before the outbreak of the Cuban
rebellion, Henry Richardson had started
sugar plantations in the interior. He had
fallen into Vasquez’s hands at the outset,
and had been systematically plundered.</p>

<p>Hal Maynard, who had come to Cuba
a year before as Mr. Richardson’s private
secretary, had detected the Spaniard in
several doubtful dealings.</p>

<p>Naturally Vasquez’s feeling for our hero
was far from cordial.</p>

<p>While Hal and his employer were still
in the interior, Vasquez had tried to involve
them in trouble with the Spanish
authorities.</p>

<p>This menace Mr. Richardson had
dodged by paying a liberal bribe to the
officer commanding the nearest garrison.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, more dangers threatened
these two Americans.</p>

<p>Then Consul General Lee’s call had
come for Americans to leave Cuba. Mr.
Richardson had gone the day before. Hal
had lingered long enough to collect two
thousand dollars due his employer. This
accomplished, he had traveled hastily to
Havana, meaning to leave there on the
historic ninth of April. We have seen
how he had reached there too late.</p>

<p>The money that Vasquez claimed as
his due was the balance of an exorbitant
bill. He had already been paid far more
than he was entitled to.</p>

<p>But he had hoped to overtake and
intimidate the American boy.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up before the hotel
door, which appeared deserted as, indeed,
it was, for with money and food both
scarce in Havana, the hotels stand but a
poor show of patronage.</p>

<p>“Your three fares, peon,” said Hal,
dropping a few coins in the driver’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Four pesetas more,” insisted the
driver.</p>

<p>Hal paid it, without protest, and disappeared
inside. He was quickly shown to
a room, and requested that his trunk be
sent up.</p>

<p>“Although I ordered that sent here
from the interior,” he smiled, as he bent
over the box, “I expected to leave it behind.”</p>

<p>Unlocking the lid, he examined the
articles in the trunk for some moments,
until a warning “Ss-sst!” reached his
ear.</p>

<p>Rising quickly, Hal saw from whence
the signal had come.</p>

<p>In the aperture made by an open skylight
overhead appeared the head of a
dark-skinned young man.</p>

<p>His bright, restless eyes took in everything
in the room, our hero included.</p>

<p>“You are an American?” he asked, as
Hal stepped under the skylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I am your friend. But have
you an enemy?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I fear I have.”</p>

<p>“Look out of the window toward the
harbor. Then come back.”</p>

<p>Hal quickly obeyed, returning with a
perturbed face.</p>

<p>“You saw Senor Vasquez approaching,
with two officers and a squad of soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Just that!” affirmed Hal.</p>

<p>“The officers have a pretense, but
Vasquez will really seek your money. If
you have it not with you, or know a safe
hiding place, you will fool him, but if the
money is in your possession, it will surely
be taken from you.”</p>

<p>Hal hesitated, regarding the speaker
with a look full of penetration.</p>

<p>What he saw was the frank, pleasing
face of a youth of eighteen. Somehow,
Hal’s heart went out to the stranger.</p>

<p>“If,” said the other, “you have the
money, and wish to save it, you can trust
it with me, senor.”</p>

<p>“What could you do with it?” projected
Hal.</p>

<p>“Drop it into one of my pockets,”
added the other, adding with a laugh:</p>

<p>“No one would search such a thin,
ragged Cuban as I for the possession of
so much money. But think quickly,
senor, for Vasquez will be here in another
moment. Juan Ramirez is my name.”</p>

<p>“A Cuban?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>“See!” And Juan drew from a pocket
what could easily become his death-warrant&mdash;a
small Cuban flag.</p>

<p>This he kissed with a simple, unaffected
air of devotion.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I’ll trust you,” murmured
Hal. “I’ve yet to meet a Cuban thief!”</p>

<p>R-rip! In a second he began to unbutton
his clothing, bringing out to view
from under his shirt a long, thin bag.</p>

<p>“This contains two thousand dollars,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>“And if anything happens to you, to
whom does the money belong?”</p>

<p>“Henry Richardson, at Key West.”</p>

<p>“He shall have it,” promised the
Cuban. “Hush! There are steps on the
stairs.”</p>

<p>Like a flash, Ramirez vanished.</p>

<p>“Have I been duped?” wondered Hal,
with a quick thrill of apprehension.</p>

<p>Ramirez had looked like a fellow to be
trusted. Yet, if Hal had kept the money
about him, it would soon pass into the
hands of Vasquez, who would be able to
persuade the Spanish judges that his
claim was just.</p>

<p>“If Ramirez has stolen it,” quivered
Hal, “all I can say is that I’d sooner see
him get it than Vasquez.”</p>

<p>Tramp! tramp! tramp! Reaching the
head of the stairs, the soldiers were now
marching straight for his door.</p>

<p>Whack! thump! The door was thrown
unceremoniously open, and the uniforms
of Spain filled the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“SPANISH EVIDENCE.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“This is the young man?”</p>

<p>One of the two officers who appeared at
the head of a file of a dozen soldiers
turned and put the question to Senor
Vasquez.</p>

<p>That consummate liar responded by a
nod of the head.</p>

<p>Though Hal Maynard had not studied
his attitude, he stood at that moment a
typical young American.</p>

<p>With feet rather spread, his hands
thrust into his trousers pockets, shoulders
manfully back and head inclining slightly
forward, he ignored Vasquez, but regarded
the officers with a rather indolent
look in which there was just a trace of
curiosity.</p>

<p>“A visitation, I presume?” he said,
addressing one of the officers in Spanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>But the latter, barely looking at him,
turned to the other officer to command:</p>

<p>“Search the trunk.”</p>

<p>“It is locked,” said Hal, stepping
slowly forward. “Permit me to offer you
the key.”</p>

<p>The officer who received it merely
grunted, and immediately knelt before
the trunk.</p>

<p>Hal stood by looking on, until one of
the soldiers, after scowling at him an instant,
darted forward and gave the boy a
push.</p>

<p>“If I am in your way,” retorted Maynard,
recovering his equilibrium, “won’t
you be kind enough to say so?”</p>

<p>“Silence!” ordered the commanding
officer.</p>

<p>Hal responded by a polite nod.</p>

<p>“These officers don’t belong to the
mob, and they should be gentlemen,” he
murmured. “If they’re not, it’s not for
me to set them the example.”</p>

<p>Flop! went a lot of Hal’s clothing,
strewed promiscuously over the floor.</p>

<p>Slap! followed his linen.</p>

<p>Smash! went a small hand mirror,
flung across the room so that it struck
the wall and landed on the floor in atoms.</p>

<p>“May I ask a question, sir?” queried
Hal, turning to the officer in charge.</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” went on Hal,
imperturbably. “All I wanted to ask was
whether my property is to be ruthlessly
destroyed before a charge has been even
made against me?”</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>“If I had committed any breach of
decorum in asking,” pursued Hal, calmly,
“please consider that I didn’t ask.”</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>Thump! The butt of a soldier’s
musket landed forcibly in Hal’s stomach.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” grunted the boy.</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>“Not even allowed to express natural
emotion,” murmured our hero. He
couldn’t have talked much in his breathless
condition, just then, even if he
wanted to.</p>

<p>He saw the soldier’s musket-butt aimed
at him, and dodged as nimbly as he
could.</p>

<p>Click!</p>

<p>Another soldier cocked his weapon,
aiming fully at the American’s head.</p>

<p>At this the commanding officer smiled.
Some of the soldiers laughed softly. They
wanted to see the Yankee flinch, and
were sure that he would&mdash;for had not
their Havana newspapers told them that
all the Yankees were cowards?</p>

<p>But Hal, who felt reasonably sure that
nothing short of violence on his part
would result in his death just then, did
not feel inwardly alarmed.</p>

<p>Instead, he slowly folded his arms,
closed one eye, and with the other squinted
down the steel barrel that stared him
in the face.</p>

<p>“Bah!” muttered he who had aimed,
now raising the muzzle of his piece.
“The Yankee pig doesn’t even know what
a gun is.”</p>

<p>“Silence!” came sharply from the
commanding officer.</p>

<p>“Well,” murmured Hal, under his
voice, “I am gratified to learn that somebody
else besides myself has to hold his
tongue. I wouldn’t like to do all the
shutting-up!”</p>

<p>It was all a picnic, so he fancied, since
he was not only sure that the officers
would find nothing compromising, but
also sure that, whoever got the money,
Senor Vasquez would not.</p>

<p>But the Spaniard, who had been narrowly
watching the boy, now interposed:</p>

<p>“Captain, may a civilian subject suggest
that the accused has not yet been
searched?”</p>

<p>“Senor,” replied the captain, bowing
slightly, “your loyal suggestion shall be
at once acted upon. I myself will make
the search.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>Thereupon the captain waved the
soldiers away, most of them withdrawing
to the corridor and doorway.</p>

<p>“Stand beside the accused,” ordered
the captain, nodding at two of his men,
who accordingly ranged themselves on
either side of the American.</p>

<p>“Senor,” said the captain, coldly,
“you will understand that what I am
about to do is a duty imposed upon me.”</p>

<p>There was a trace of civility about this,
which caused Hal to reply politely:</p>

<p>“If it is your duty, captain, I would
be the last one to urge you from it. But
I can tell you what I have about me. I
have a pocket knife and a sum of money.”</p>

<p>“Money?” uttered Vasquez, becoming
alert at once. “It is mine&mdash;mine by
right!”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied Hal,
coldly; “but if you need it you may
have it. I have only three pesetas.”</p>

<p>“Three pesetas?” faltered the Spanish
merchant. He looked as angry as a man
who is being robbed, for three pesetas is
but about sixty cents.</p>

<p>“You may have it,” rejoined Hal,
with mock generosity, “if the officer permits
me to present it to you.”</p>

<p>Then he threw his hands up while the
captain went through his pockets.</p>

<p>That officer looked a trifle ashamed of
his task, for an army officer is a gentleman,
at least by education.</p>

<p>But Hal’s pockets, under the most rigid
search, showed no more than he had
mentioned.</p>

<p>“Off with your clothes, senor,” came
the next command.</p>

<p>Hal looked and felt a trifle surprised,
but saw that the order was a serious one.</p>

<p>“Shall I er&mdash;er&mdash;withdraw to the closet
before disrobing?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Naturally not,” was the dry answer.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. Hal had to
obey, which he did with the poorest grace
in the world.</p>

<p>But he passed through this ordeal like
the others without mishap, and was curtly
informed that he could put on his clothing
again.</p>

<p>This Hal did, next standing at ease
between the two soldiers.</p>

<p>“Do you find anything?” asked the
captain, turning to his subordinate.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“A mare’s nest, eh?” smiled the captain,
grimly.</p>

<p>Hal duplicated the smile, but in a more
genial manner, then turned to look at
Vasquez.</p>

<p>But that Spaniard suddenly darted over
to the trunk, knelt beside the lieutenant,
and began to help rummage among the
few remaining articles there.</p>

<p>“Ha! Here is something,” announced
Vasquez, holding up a slip of paper.</p>

<p>Hal looked on, wide-eyed, for he knew
well that no such paper had been among
his possessions when he packed them.</p>

<p>Then he gave a gasp, for he realized
the Spaniard’s game at last. That scoundrel,
by some clever legerdemain, had
slipped a paper among Maynard’s effects.</p>

<p>“Ho!” grunted the Spaniard, running
his eyes over the page. “This is a
note, apparently, from one of the comrades
of that bandit chief, Gomez.”</p>

<p>He finished reading, while the captain
stood looking calmly on.</p>

<p>“An American plotter!” screamed
Vasquez. “This is proof conclusive
enough to merit for him a dozen deaths
if that were possible!”</p>

<p>He held the page in one hand, pointing
a denouncing finger at our startled
hero.</p>

<p>“Let me see it,” commanded the captain.
“A letter relating to a filibustering
expedition, eh? This is, indeed, evidence.
So!” turning to Maynard. “You are
one of the Yankees who help his majesty’s
subjects to rebel.”</p>

<p>“Upon my honor,” protested Hal, “I
know nothing about that letter.”</p>

<p>“Your honor?” cried the captain.<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
“Bah, you Yankee pig! Lieutenant,
bring him along under guard. To the
Prefatura.”</p>

<p>To the Prefatura! To Havana’s police
headquarters? Over the door of that
grim building might well be written,
“All hope abandon, ye who enter here!”</p>

<p>It was at the door of this building that
all trace had been lost of countless Cuban
insurgents, the members of their families,
and of others who had in any way been
suspected of sympathy with the cause of
the rebels.</p>

<p>From here, in the late hours of night,
countless doomed ones had been led away,
ostensibly to imprisonment in Morro
Castle or Cabanas Fortress&mdash;with this
horrible peculiarity, that they had never
reached their destinations or been heard
from again!</p>

<p>To the Prefatura! For an instant, contemplating
the letter which the captain
now held in his hand, Hal felt his heart
sinking utterly.</p>

<p>“I was sure I could not be mistaken,”
murmured Senor Vasquez, softly.</p>

<p>That voice aroused the American as the
bite of a snake would have done.</p>

<p>“Senor Vasquez,” he cried, throwing
his head back proudly, “we have not
seen the end of this matter!”</p>

<p>Then, bowing to the captain, Hal
stepped between the two files of soldiers
as they formed.</p>

<p>Down the stairs they started. Vasquez
brought up the rear, gnashing his teeth.</p>

<p>He had found no trace of the money.</p>

<p>But perhaps he yet hoped to!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AT THE PREFATURA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hal marched through the main entrance
to the Prefatura.</p>

<p>His bearing was as proud as ever.</p>

<p>He could not have shown more fortitude
had he felt that the whole honor of
Old Glory was resting on his youthful
shoulders.</p>

<p>He had marched for more than two
miles through the streets, his military
escort taking a roundabout course, as if
they enjoyed displaying this dangerous
captive to the excited populace.</p>

<p>He had been jeered at, jibed at, made
the butt of hundreds of coarse jokes.</p>

<p>At last he had reached the Prefatura.
Senor Vasquez still brought up the rear.
He carried himself with the air of one
who wishes it understood that he has
done his duty by his country.</p>

<p>In the corridor of the Prefatura Hal’s
escort halted until it could be learned before
which official the prisoner was to be
taken.</p>

<p>In the same corridor were other prisoners,
each under guard.</p>

<p>There was only this difference: Hal
Maynard was erect, rosy, healthy-looking.
The other poor wretches, most of whom
were women, were plainly Cubans.</p>

<p>Their invariably starved appearance
showed them to be reconcentrados&mdash;people
from the interior who had been driven
in by General Weyler’s infamous order,
and then left to starve.</p>

<p>There was little, if any, acute terror in
their fates. They had suffered so much,
had witnessed so many atrocities, that
they were indifferent to what was yet to
come.</p>

<p>Paris, during the Reign of Terror, was
not such a city of horrors as Havana has
lately been!</p>

<p>Captain Tamiva, Hal’s chief captor,
still bearing the letter “found” in the
boy’s trunk, disappeared into one of the
numerous offices opening upon the corridor.</p>

<p>He soon came back, ordering the
soldiers to take their prisoner in.</p>

<p>Hal found himself arraigned before a
stern-looking, elderly Spaniard. Before
the latter, on his desk, lay the accusing
letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>He looked up quickly, this official,
shot a penetrating look into the boy’s
face, and snarled out:</p>

<p>“So you are another of the Yankee
pigs who root with our Cuban sucklings!”</p>

<p>“I am an American citizen, certainly,”
replied Hal.</p>

<p>“And a sympathizer, as I said.”</p>

<p>“I have never held communication
with the insurgents.”</p>

<p>“But this letter?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“It was found in your trunk.”</p>

<p>“Though never placed there by me.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Of what avail is lying? Do
you think you are talking to some of
your own stupid Yankees? Confess!”</p>

<p>“How can I,” retorted Hal, “when
there is nothing to confess?”</p>

<p>The official scowled, snorting impatiently:</p>

<p>“Time is valuable. We have too many
cases like yours to attend to. The island
is full of treason. Instantly tell me all
you know about this letter, and the plans
at which it hints, or take the consequences.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing that I can tell you,”
rejoined Hal, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Then take the consequences!”</p>

<p>“I shall have to, since I can’t run away
from them.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then this is the disposition
of your case: At ten to-night you
shall be rowed across the harbor to Morro
Castle. Once in a dungeon there you will
be out of my jurisdiction, and thenceforth
under the eye of General Blanco.”</p>

<p>All the while Senor Vasquez had stood
by looking silently on with his eager,
burning eyes.</p>

<p>“One moment,” he now interposed.
“May I have a word with the prisoner.”</p>

<p>“To one of such known loyalty as
Senor Vasquez,” replied the police official,
politely, “no favor can be refused.”</p>

<p>Vasquez led our hero to the other end
of the room.</p>

<p>“You are to go to Morro Castle,”
whispered the Spaniard, warningly. “Do
you know what that means?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” retorted Hal. “Solitary confinement
until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Until&mdash;&mdash;” followed Vasquez, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Until American sailors and soldiers
purify that loathsome place by planting
the American flag over it.”</p>

<p>“Fool!” hissed Vasquez. “Do you
imagine you will ever reach Morro?”</p>

<p>“I know only what that official said.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let me tell you,” snarled
the Spaniard, “that you will only embark
in a boat that will start across the harbor.
By and by that boat will return without
you, but you will never have reached
Morro! You will never be heard from
again!”</p>

<p>“And it is for this you have plotted?”
cried Hal, paling, but otherwise keeping
his composure.</p>

<p>“If I have plotted,” murmured Vasquez,
rapidly, “it was for my own good.
You would not expect me to serve another
than myself, would you?”</p>

<p>“No!” came the answer, with withering
sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Now, my young friend,” went on
the plotter, dropping into a cooing voice,
“if I am a dangerous enemy, let us forget
that. I am also a good friend. Your employer
owed me the money which you
collected. Put me in the way of finding
that, and I have influence enough here to
secure your freedom.”</p>

<p>“Now, listen to me,” retorted Hal,
spiritedly. “Whether my employer owes
you the money or not is nothing for me
to decide. But I will tell you this honestly:
I don’t know where the money is, at
this moment. If I wanted to play into
your hands, I simply couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“You are lying!” gnashed Vasquez,
but a searching look into the boy’s face
soon convinced that shrewd judge of<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
human nature that Maynard spoke the
truth.</p>

<p>“I am not going to waste more time
on you,” went on the Spaniard, passionately.
“If you send for me before it is too
late, I will come. As you value even a
few more days of life, don’t tempt fate
by taking the trip across the harbor to-night!”</p>

<p>Murmuring these words in the boy’s
ears, the scoundrel turned to dart way.</p>

<p>As he did so, another man moved forward,
saying quietly:</p>

<p>“I will speak with the prisoner now.”</p>

<p>Hal did not know the speaker until
Vasquez stammered:</p>

<p>“The British consul general!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the visitor, Mr. Gollan,
“I was informed that a British subject
named Maynard had been arrested. I
hurried here only to learn that Maynard
is an American citizen. Is that the
case?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir,” affirmed Hal.</p>

<p>“Still,” smiled Mr. Gollan, “perhaps
I can do something. At the request of
my government, Consul General Lee
turned over to me this afternoon the
papers and duties of his office. Mr. Maynard,
can you suggest any service that I
can do you?”</p>

<p>“Now, I should say so!” vented overjoyed
Hal. “I have been arrested on false
charges and a trumped-up paper. Can
you not demand to see that document?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Mr. Gollan.
“Come with me.”</p>

<p>Together they stepped before the official
who had just condemned Hal to
Morro Castle.</p>

<p>“Do you mind my looking at the letter
on which this young man’s arrest was
ordered?” asked Mr. Gollan.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered the official,
at the same time raising the paper from
his desk and handing it over.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>As Gollan ran his eyes over the paper,
Hal stood looking on at the spectacle
that meant the turning point for his life
or death.</p>

<p>Suddenly our hero started, uttered an
exclamation of astonishment, and snatched
the paper from Mr. Gollan’s hands.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” came impetuously
from the boy, “but do you see this
other side of the sheet? It is one of Vasquez’s
own business letter heads! He has
blundered by not looking at the other
side of the sheet on which he wrote! It
bears out my charge that he trumped up
this letter, for, bear in mind, sir, it was
he who pretended to find it in my
trunk!”</p>

<p>“Car-r-r-r-ramba!” exploded Vasquez,
first turning white, next purpling with
wrath.</p>

<p>Back went the paper into the police
official’s hands.</p>

<p>Senor Vasquez tried to explain; the
police official asked a half a dozen questions
in a breath, while Captain Tamiva
had much to say.</p>

<p>But over all the hubbub arose Consul
Gollan’s voice:</p>

<p>“As representative both of the interests
of Great Britain and the United States, I
ask for the instant release of this prisoner.”</p>

<p>Too disconcerted to speak, the police
official could only nod his consent.</p>

<p>Hal felt an arm thrust through his. In
a maze he was led down the corridor and
into the square.</p>

<p>Then a hearty voice said:</p>

<p>“My young friend, I am very glad to
have served you. I would advise you to
leave Cuba at once.”</p>

<p>“I intend to,” responded Hal. “I saw
an English brig loading at one of the
wharves. I think I will try to get passage
on her.”</p>

<p>“The Emeline Atwood&mdash;a good vessel,”
replied Mr. Gollan. “She is bound,
too, for Norfolk.”</p>

<p>Then, after much hand-shaking and<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
many protestations of thanks from Hal,
he turned down one of the side streets to
the water front.</p>

<p>The narrow thoroughfares appeared deserted.
He walked quickly.</p>

<p>“Now, that was stupid of me,” muttered
the boy, after going a quarter of a
mile. “Why didn’t I think to ask who it
was that took word to Mr. Gollan? Could
it have been Ramirez?”</p>

<p>“Senor! senor!” whispered a voice
through the shutters of a window.
“Walk faster, and remember that you
are being followed!”</p>

<p>Like a shot Hal halted, trying to catch
sight of his informant.</p>

<p>“No, don’t stop! Don’t look this way,
or you’ll betray me,” came the whisper.
“But hurry! The deadliest danger hovers
over you in the next five minutes!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“A SPANIARD OF HONOR!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>The acknowledgment, softly uttered as
the warning, floated back over Hal Maynard’s
shoulder as he struck out on the
double-quick for the water front.</p>

<p>Once he turned. Over his shoulder he
saw three indistinct figures following him
down the street.</p>

<p>Fast as he was traveling, the pursuers
increased their speed until they seemed
likely to overtake him.</p>

<p>“Is this more of Vasquez’s deadly
work?” groaned Hal. “Will he never
stop until he has destroyed me?”</p>

<p>Cold perspiration oozed out on the
boy’s forehead.</p>

<p>He broke into a swift run.</p>

<p>At this gait, he calculated that less
than three minutes would bring him to
the English brig’s wharf.</p>

<p>As he ran, he took a flying look over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Hardly more than two hundred feet to
the rear were the pursuers, their sandaled
feet moving without noise.</p>

<p>“I can beat them,” thrilled Hal, putting
on an even better spurt of speed.</p>

<p>Just ahead was the water-front street.</p>

<p>Here, a swift turn to the right, and a
speedy dash would carry him to the
wharf he sought.</p>

<p>Trip! Hal’s feet became entangled in
something stretched across the sidewalk.</p>

<p>He plunged, then fell to the sidewalk,
measuring his full length there.</p>

<p>More quickly than he could rise, a figure
darted out of the doorway.</p>

<p>Across the boy’s body a man hurled
himself.</p>

<p>“You’ll fight for it&mdash;sure!” vented
Hal, gripping the stranger by the throat.</p>

<p>They grappled, struggled, breath coming
quick and short.</p>

<p>Hal fought like a tiger. He quickly
placed himself on top of his assailant, but
could not wrench himself loose.</p>

<p>Pit-patter-pat! Soft sandals struck the
sidewalk as the three shadows rushed
upon the scene.</p>

<p>Not pausing an instant, they hurled
themselves into the melee.</p>

<p>Many hands grappled the boy at once.</p>

<p>Maynard fought with renewed fury,
but what could he do against so many?</p>

<p>One seized him by either arm and
shoulder, another grasped his kicking
feet.</p>

<p>“Help! help! help! Thieves!” roared
the victim, but his captor-carriers did not
even attempt to stifle his cries&mdash;the surest
way of proving that they had no reason
to fear interference.</p>

<p>Hal’s first assailant now darted back
into the doorway, unlocking a door,
and making way for the squad to enter.</p>

<p>Still kicking and squirming, Hal Maynard
was carried through the house and
out into a courtyard at the rear.</p>

<p>Here he renewed his shouts, with no
other effect than to make his captors
smile maliciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>At the rear of the yard a gate was unlocked.</p>

<p>Hal Maynard involuntarily crossed a
second yard, after which those who carried
him entered another house.</p>

<p>Here he was carried into one of the
rooms, and unceremoniously dumped
upon the floor.</p>

<p>“You stay there,” muttered he who
appeared to be the spokesman, “unless
you are foolish enough to try to escape.”</p>

<p>“What would be the use?” grated Hal,
inwardly. “They wouldn’t be so sure of
me if there was a dog’s chance to crawl
out.”</p>

<p>The spokesman went out, but the other
three remained.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling! tinkled a bell in
another room.</p>

<p>“A telephone,” conjectured Hal.
“Will Senor Enrique Vasquez be at the
other end of the wire?”</p>

<p>Though he listened intently, he could
not hear the words spoken into the
receiver.</p>

<p>Presently the fourth man came back.</p>

<p>As Hal had not made any effort to get
up, his jailers now squatted upon the
floor, lighting paper cigarettes and puffing
incessantly.</p>

<p>Minute after minute dragged by.</p>

<p>Hal did not address a word to his captors.
Neither did he shout for help, for
he felt sure that he would not have been
left ungagged had they feared that his
voice would reach friendly ears.</p>

<p>Nor did his captors speak, beyond an
occasional word addressed to one another.</p>

<p>“Whatever is to be done, they are
merely the agents of some one else,”
cogitated Hal, his mind as busy as his
tongue was idle. “Vasquez bragged about
his agents. Are these some of them? If
so, they <a id="Ref_14" href="#BRef_14">are</a> not a lot to boast about!”</p>

<p>His reflections were cut short by the
sound of the wheels of an arriving carriage.</p>

<p>Then steps sounded in a hallway, next
at the door.</p>

<p>The door opened, to give entrance to
Senor Vasquez, as Hal had expected.</p>

<p>As the Spaniard’s burning gaze fell
upon the boy, his face darkened, though
his lips smiled.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Senor Maynard,” was
his greeting. “Did you think that you
had seen the last of me?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” gritted Hal. “I have always
heard that the devil is more busy
than successful.”</p>

<p>“Take a seat, senor,” urged Vasquez,
pushing forward one of the few chairs in
the room. “As to you, my good fellows,”
turning to the four thugs who had vanquished
Hal, “you may step just outside
the door.”</p>

<p>As almost anything was more comfortable
than the floor, Hal availed himself
of the chair.</p>

<p>Next he turned a look of cool scrutiny
upon the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Yet, if Hal looked cool, his appearance
was far from expressing his feelings.</p>

<p>He fully realized that never before had
he been in such a critical situation.</p>

<p>In fact, with such a foe as Vasquez,
who, under the circumstances could not be
placated, there was little hope that the
American could escape with his life.</p>

<p>Senor Vasquez drew out a cigar, lighted
it, and puffed slowly for some time before
he began to speak.</p>

<p>Yet, while thinking, his brow grew
blacker.</p>

<p>“Senor Maynard,” he finally blurted
out, “are you not ashamed to be an
American?”</p>

<p>Hal turned eyes that were wide open
with surprise upon the man pacing the
floor before him.</p>

<p>“Ashamed of being an American?”
he repeated. “Senor Vasquez, are you
training for a humorist? How can any
American live without finding life one<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
long thrill of pride that he is part and
parcel of the Stars and Stripes?”</p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted Vasquez, impatiently.
“Shall I tell you what your greatest fault
is?”</p>

<p>“If you care to.”</p>

<p>“You Americans are not honest,” went
on the Spaniard. “You lie, cheat and
steal, always pouring the pesetas or dollars
into your pockets, and laughing at
the more simple more honest people of
other nations from whom you derive your
dishonest profits. Nowhere do you find
easier victims than the old-fashioned,
simple, trusting, generous, honest Spaniards.”</p>

<p>“Of whom I suppose you are one?”</p>

<p>“Of whom,” repeated Vasquez, sadly,
“I am one.”</p>

<p>Hal could not keep back the burst of
laughter that sprang to his lips.</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh?” demanded Vasquez,
angrily. “Because you have duped
me so easily?”</p>

<p>“Because you have duped yourself so
easily,” retorted Hal, with spirit. “You
vaunt your honesty, you who have never
earned an honest dollar in your whole
career. You, a simple, trusting man,
when you cannot look back upon a single
month in twenty years when you
have not used the fear of fire or the assassin’s
knife to inforce the payment of
exorbitant claims against Americans who
were new to the island! When you look
into your own heart, Vasquez, can you
blame me for laughing at your pretenses?”</p>

<p>But Hal did not laugh now. His voice
rang with a scorn and contempt that
were too deep for merriment.</p>

<p>“Your employer owed me money,”
went on Vasquez, plaintively.</p>

<p>“He has paid you far more than he
ever owed you. That I know from the
dealings I have had between you. As near
as I could place it, you have robbed him,
in three years, of at least twenty thousand
dollars more than you were entitled
to. Yet you prate about honesty!”</p>

<p>“He owes me two thousand dollars,”
insisted the Spaniard, doggedly. “Senor
Richardson escaped from Cuba yesterday,
and left me sighing in vain for my
money. I find that you have collected,
within the last twenty-four hours, money
of his enough to pay me. Yet you refuse
to turn it over to me.”</p>

<p>“Of course I refused,” voiced Hal. “I
should have been false to my trust if I
had paid over my employer’s money without
authority from him.”</p>

<p>“And that is why I call you dishonest,”
cried Vasquez. “You have conspired,
you two, to defraud me of my
money.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t conspire to have me sent to
Morro Castle, did you?” sneered Maynard.</p>

<p>“Now,” resume the Spaniard, ignoring
all the inconvenient points in Hal’s
reply, “I have stated fully my grievance
against you. Do not think, you Yankee
pig, that you can hope to dupe me any
longer. You are now dealing with a
Spaniard of honor!”</p>

<p>Vasquez drew himself erect and puffed
his chest out as if he believed his vainglorious
boast.</p>

<p>Halting suddenly before the boy, he
glared at Hal with burning eyes, and
demanded, with a pause after each word:</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;is&mdash;that&mdash;money?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Yet you had it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly?”</p>

<p>“Then what did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“I shall never tell you,” retorted Hal,
with spirit.</p>

<p>Now Vasquez’s passion escaped all
bounds.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Yankees! Oh, you thieves!”
he declared, violently, pacing the room
like a caged hyena. “You hope to dupe
us, even when you are in our power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>Then his voice became sarcastic, as he
went on:</p>

<p>“Senor, do you know how we Spaniards
love you Yankees? Do you realize
what happiness it would give us to caress
you? To caress each and every one of
your people&mdash;to caress them so?”</p>

<p>Pausing in his agitated walk, Vasquez
drew a knife, making a significant gesture
of cutting a throat.</p>

<p>“That is the way we would like to
treat all you Yankees,” went on the
Spaniard. “No! I mistake. That would
be much too quick a punishment. We
must be more ingenious in our punishment
of the impudent Yankees&mdash;even as
I propose to deal with you now.”</p>

<p>Under that fierce, malicious gaze, Hal
Maynard felt himself growing “creepy.”</p>

<p>It did not afford him much satisfaction,
even, to see Vasquez put away his
knife, for the Spaniard’s word and manner
left little doubt that the knife would
be put aside only in favor of a more fearful
method of revenge.</p>

<p>“Senor, I ask you, for the last time,
what did you do with the money?”</p>

<p>“And I refuse to tell you a word.”</p>

<p>“Did you understand that I was asking
for the last time?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Hal fairly hurled the short, defiant
retort.</p>

<p>As Senor Vasquez realized that it was
too late for parley, he raised his voice,
shouting:</p>

<p>“Pedro! Jose!”</p>

<p>Instantly the door opened. Vasquez’s
four agents filed into the room.</p>

<p>“Bind the pig! Gag him!” directed
the Spaniard, tremulously.</p>

<p>These orders were swiftly carried out,
for, though Hal Maynard struggled manfully,
he was like clay in the hands of so
many desperate fellows. Weights were
tied to his feet.</p>

<p>“He is ready,” voiced Vasquez, glaring
at last at his helpless foe. “Pedro,
open the shutters over there.”</p>

<p>Out he was thrust, face down, his
startled eyes gazing down at the muddy
water of Havana harbor but a few feet
below him.</p>

<p>“Ready, my good fellows?” quivered
Vasquez.</p>

<p>“Ready, senor!”</p>

<p>“Then drop him!”</p>

<p>Through the darkness of the night
shot a human form.</p>

<p>Plash!</p>

<p>Hal Maynard’s bound and weighted
form sank below the foul waters.</p>

<p>He had gone to share, in a different
way, the fate of the Maine heroes!</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CUBA’S NEW RECRUIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Rub! rub! rub!</p>

<p>Chafe! chafe! chafe!</p>

<p>Under the shed over a wharf one
human figure bent over another.</p>

<p>Rub! rub! rub!</p>

<p>With the quiet but energetic heroism
of common humanity, the rescuer strove
to bring back the spark of life to a young
man only just snatched from the engulfing
waters.</p>

<p>“It is odd, strange!” muttered the rubber,
pausing for an instant to look at the
lifeless figure. “Can it be possible that I
was too late&mdash;or that I am too clumsy?”</p>

<p>He bent anxiously over the still figure.</p>

<p>“It would be a great thing to fool
Senor Vasquez,” murmured the Cuban,
for such he was. “Moreover, I would like
greatly to save this American, who
trusted me even as I trusted him.”</p>

<p>For some minutes more he continued to
chafe the wrists and body of Hal Maynard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>“A sip or two of brandy might save
him&mdash;but how shall one get brandy,
which costs twenty-five pesetas a bottle?
Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Juan Ramirez suddenly and resolutely
checked the thought that perhaps
he might be justified in using some of
the money intrusted to him by our hero.</p>

<p>“He said that belonged to another.
Therefore he would not thank me to use
some of it to save his life.”</p>

<p>Such was the simple creed of honor of
this Cuban.</p>

<p>He was soon rewarded, however, by a
flutter of the eyelids, a sigh from the unconscious
one.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! He still lives!” cried
the Cuban, now overjoyed, and working as
if his own life depended upon the result.</p>

<p>A minute later Hal Maynard opened
his eyes.</p>

<p>Juan bent so low over him that, despite
the darkness, our hero recognized his
rescuer.</p>

<p>“Ramirez?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“At your service, Senor Americano.”</p>

<p>“But I was dropped into the harbor&mdash;weighted.”</p>

<p>“And I, senor, was fortunate enough
to be near by.”</p>

<p>Hal blinked stupidly, having by no
means recovered his wits as yet.</p>

<p>“Rest easily, and breathe freely,”
counseled the Cuban. “Do not try to
move yet. Do not even try to think.”</p>

<p>Hal obeyed, lying there for two or
three minutes before he tried again to
speak.</p>

<p>“Where are we now?” he asked,
finally.</p>

<p>“Senor, I would caution you not to
speak above a whisper. We are both in
danger, if some unfriendly prowler should
overhear us. Let me raise you&mdash;so.
Now, do you see the building over yonder
that rests upon the water’s edge?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was from one of those windows
that you were dropped.”</p>

<p>“And you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was prowling near, senor. No
sooner did the scoundrels hear the splash
than they closed the window. It was then
that I dove into the harbor, swam to you,
and found you some ten feet below the
surface. It was a simple matter to cut the
ropes that bound the weights to you.
Then I brought you here. That is all,
senor.”</p>

<p>“All?” echoed Hal, now sitting up.
“It seems to me, my friend, that you
make a very modest statement of your
noble action.”</p>

<p>“Senor, to-day you trusted me. In
return I could not do less.”</p>

<p>“And it was you, I am sure, who went
to the British consulate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was there, senor.”</p>

<p>“And it was you who lodged the information
that resulted in my release at
the Prefatura.”</p>

<p>“It was I, senor, as you have guessed,”
Ramirez quietly replied.</p>

<p>“You have been my good angel to-day,”
cried Maynard, gratefully.</p>

<p>“I could not do less, senor, after a
stranger had trusted me.”</p>

<p>“And it was you who warned me to-night
that I was being followed.”</p>

<p>“Wrong this time, senor. It was a
friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Yet he worked at your instigation?”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“And, finally, you have saved me
from certain death.”</p>

<p>“All of which, Senor Americano, gives
me occasion to rejoice,” answered the
Cuban, simply.</p>

<p>Hal now managed to get upon his feet.
No sooner did he find himself facing the
Cuban than he warmly grasped the latter’s
hand.</p>

<p>“I owe you my life and the safety of
my money,” cried Maynard, impulsively.
“Yet I never saw you before to-day.
Pardon me if such great friendliness bewilders
me.”</p>

<p>“I have done only what any Cuban<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
would do for an American,” was the
quiet reply. “I offer you one more service
before leaving you. You were
bound to some ship?”</p>

<p>“The British brig, Emeline Atwood.”</p>

<p>“I know her berth. I will lead you
there. Once on board, you should be safe.
Come; I will show you the way, senor.”</p>

<p>“Wait just one instant,” implored
Hal. “Ramirez, such friendship as you
have shown to-day is seldom met with.
Pardon me if I seek to learn something
about you.”</p>

<p>“There is little to tell,” responded the
Cuban. “I love this people and their
island, for I am one of them. I have
done, as perhaps you have guessed, all in
my power to serve Cuba. You see, senor,
I do not hesitate to trust you. You will
wonder why one of my sentiments is not
in the Cuban army. I will answer that
question before you ask it. It is forbidden
to a Cuban to join our patriot army unless
he can bring with him a gun and
some ammunition. When I can do that, I
shall leave Havana and take to the long
grass where the insurgents, if not as
thick as locusts, are fighting as bravely
as lions. Beyond that I can tell you little,
except that I have no living relatives.
All have died of starvation, and my greatest
dread is that I shall starve before I
am ready to strike out for the long
grass.”</p>

<p>Simple and brief as Ramirez’s statement
was, it was the eloquent account of
a patriot who would die for his cause and
country, and who would die with equal
cheerfulness, either of starvation in
Havana, or under arms in the field.</p>

<p>There were tears in Hal’s eyes as he
heard the simple story.</p>

<p>But Ramirez cut short his reflections
by saying:</p>

<p>“Senor, not all of our danger is behind
us. If you are going to the English ship,
let me advise you that we should start at
once.”</p>

<p>“Just one more question before we
go,” interposed Hal. “You spoke of a
gun and ammunition. Can they be obtained
here in Havana?”</p>

<p>“When one has the price, senor.”</p>

<p>“And what is that price?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I had twenty-five dollars I
could buy a rifle and a pocketful of cartridges.
But, why speculate? Twenty-five
dollars is not to be found.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” responded Hal.
“Let us find the brig.”</p>

<p>Ramirez guided him from the wharf
and led him down a dark street, halting
every few steps to make sure that they
were not being followed.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, the Cuban, every instant
alert, dragged our hero into a doorway.</p>

<p>“Here comes the patrol,” whispered
Juan.</p>

<p>Hal listened, yet it was some moments
before he could hear the tramp of soldiers.</p>

<p>“Your hearing is wonderful,” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“It is said,” replied Ramirez, “that
starvation quickens all the senses.”</p>

<p>“And you are starving?” uttered Hal,
feeling as if he were choking.</p>

<p>“Far from it,” was the answer. “I
ate a quarter of a loaf of bread the day
before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And since&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have had several drinks of water,
but it was warm and therefore not palatable.”</p>

<p>Terrible as this statement was, it was
made quietly, without the least trace of a
desire to parade misery.</p>

<p>Tears glistened in Hal Maynard’s eyes.
He was about to speak when Ramirez cut
him short by whispering:</p>

<p>“I find that this door behind us opens.
That is fortunate, for otherwise we
would perhaps be captured.”</p>

<p>Silently both moved into the hallway.
Trying not even to breathe, they listened<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
as a score of Spanish regulars or volunteers
marched by.</p>

<p>Only a few yards further on they heard
the command halt. Then followed a dialogue
between an officer and a belated
pedestrian.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that the latter
could not give a satisfactory account of
himself, for they heard the officer break
in sharply:</p>

<p>“Enough! Step in between the files.
You shall tell the rest of your story at
the Prefatura.”</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp! sounded the squad,
marching on again. Ramirez listened
until long after Hal had heard the last
footfall.</p>

<p>Then the door was opened once more,
and the pair stole out to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“We are safe,” breathed Ramirez.
“Walk quickly for a minute, and you
will be aboard your ship.”</p>

<p>A prediction that was realized, for,
without further mishap, they reached the
wharf and walked its length.</p>

<p>“Who comes here?” growled a gruff
voice.</p>

<p>Hal’s heart gave a jump at sound of
the old, dear, familiar English tongue.</p>

<p>“We are friends. I am an American,”
he replied, stepping in advance. “I
wish to speak with the captain.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find him on board, sir,” replied
the sailor, more respectfully.</p>

<p>“I must leave you, senor,” whispered
Ramirez, adding, when he saw Hal’s
look of surprise: “The money that you
intrusted to me I left with friends. Do
not be uneasy. In twenty minutes you
should see me back.”</p>

<p>Before Hal could grasp his hand to
wring it, Ramirez had glided off in the
shadows.</p>

<p>“Of all the true hearts in the world,”
gasped Maynard, admiringly. “Will he
come back? I wish I were as sure of
heaven!”</p>

<p>Without a doubt regarding Ramirez,
our hero turned and went aboard the
brig.</p>

<p>Only three words of introduction were
needed to secure a warm grasp from Captain
Blodgett’s hand:</p>

<p>“I’m an American.”</p>

<p>“And left behind, eh?” demanded the
captain. “We sail at midnight; Norfolk;
there’s plenty of room aboard.”</p>

<p>“May I speak confidentially with you,
sir?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>They conversed in low tones by the
rail for ten minutes. After that they
turned, looking shoreward.</p>

<p>At length, Ramirez appeared. No
sooner did he reach the wharf than he
struck into a trot that did not slacken
until the Cuban reached the Atwood’s
deck.</p>

<p>“Your money, senor,” announced the
breathless messenger.</p>

<p>Diving under his jacket, he produced
a bag.</p>

<p>“To my belief it has not been opened.
Nevertheless, senor, you will do me a
great favor to count the money, and thus
acquit me of all suspicion.”</p>

<p>“At your request only I do so,” answered
Hal. “Captain, may we use the
table in your cabin?”</p>

<p>“In more ways than one,” was the
hearty answer. “Follow me below, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>There, upon the table the bag was
opened, the money poured forth.</p>

<p>Not much time was required in the
counting. Two thousand dollars was
restored to the bag. The balance, sixty
dollars, Hal stowed away in his own
pockets.</p>

<p>“My own money,” he announced.
“Ramirez, how can I ever thank you for
all your honesty and goodness?”</p>

<p>“Since your people have been our
friends for three years,” came the reply,
“it is enough for me to know that I have<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
served an American. And now I must
take my leave of this vessel.”</p>

<p>“I also,” replied Hal, rising.</p>

<p>“You?” echoed Ramirez, amazed,
while Captain Blodgett looked gravely on.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” rejoined Hal; “I am
going with you.”</p>

<p>“With me, senor? Where, may I
ask?”</p>

<p>“To the long grass, if you will take
me.”</p>

<p>“You? Santa Maria! Do you mean,
senor, that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, utterly bewildered, but Hal
Maynard finished, quickly:</p>

<p>“Ramirez, I saw a man when I met
you. I am anxious to prove my own
manhood. I offer myself as a recruit to
fight Spain!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE TEMPTATION OF PEDRO.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Had a bombshell exploded near the
Cuban, he could not have been more
excited.</p>

<p>“You a recruit?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Why not?” laughed Hal. “Am I not
healthy enough, or do you fear that I
would run at the first fire?”</p>

<p>“Senor, you would be a valuable recruit,
but you are not a Cuban.”</p>

<p>“Is that a disqualification?”</p>

<p>“But this rebellion is not your affair,
senor. You belong to a free people, and
have no need to fight for Cuba.”</p>

<p>“There are already many Americans
who take a different view. With Maximo
Gomez and Calixta Garcia there are
scores, if not hundreds, of American citizens.
I have not heard that they make
poor soldiers. Ramirez, I owe my life to
you. You are a Cuban. Therefore, I owe
my life to Cuba. I have no family ties;
no obligation except to my employer.
Captain Blodgett has undertaken to deliver
the money to him. There is nothing
to hold me back. You have remained
in Havana because you did not have the
twenty-five dollars with which to buy a
gun. I have enough to buy two. Will
you take me to the insurgents, or will
you go alone?”</p>

<p>Ramirez still hesitated for a moment;
next he darted forward seizing Hal’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Senor, if you are in earnest, I will
show you the way.”</p>

<p>“It is settled, then,” was all Hal Maynard
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is glorious!” cried Ramirez,
his eyes becoming misty. “At last I am
to be able to join the Cuban army. More
than that, I shall take a comrade with
me.”</p>

<p>“Here is all the money I have in the
world,” added Hal, turning his funds
over to Juan. “Henceforth, it belongs to
Cuba.”</p>

<p>“Let us lose not a moment’s time,”
urged Ramirez, his eyes dancing with
delight. “Senor, I am afraid to move,
for fear I shall wake up and find it all a
dream. I cannot delay for a second.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” broke in Captain
Blodgett, “I hope you will dally here for
a little while. Young men, you are starting
into an island where starvation reigns.
Let me offer you a square meal&mdash;the last,
perhaps, that you will get for weeks to
come.”</p>

<p>“I do not need food,” declared Juan,
trying to puff out his thin cheeks. “Happiness
will sustain me.”</p>

<p>“I’m hungry, and not ashamed to say
so,” interposed Hal, with a laugh. “If
Captain Blodgett will do something to
relieve that, I beg you, my dear fellow,
to wait here a few moments.”</p>

<p>Juan reluctantly consented. A bustling
steward soon had the table spread with
hearty food.</p>

<p>Hal ate a hearty meal. Ramirez fed
like one famished.</p>

<p>“Bah!” uttered the Cuban, rising in
disgust at last. “I have made such a wolf<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
of myself that I am not fit to walk. But
to you, captain, I offer a thousand thanks
for your hospitality, and a thousand
apologies for the spectacle I have made of
myself.”</p>

<p>“I shall hold together until to-morrow,”
murmured Hal, rising with a satisfied
air. “Captain, my most earnest
thanks.”</p>

<p>Now the bustling steward came back
with two parcels of food which he helped
the young men to stow away under their
jackets.</p>

<p>Captain Blodgett, hearty, if somewhat
taciturn, followed them to the deck,
slipping into Hal’s hand a receipt for the
money, which he undertook to forward
to its destination.</p>

<p>“The best of good luck, lads,” came
in an earnest whisper from the English
captain, as he offered each a hand at the
same time.</p>

<p>They stepped ashore, Ramirez acting
as guide.</p>

<p>Of all that followed, during the next
two hours, Hal had, at the end of that
time, only the vague recollection that
follows a dream.</p>

<p>But they reached the southern outskirts
of Havana without mishap; they trudged
along a dusty country road, dodging behind
trees or into the brush whenever
Ramirez’s acute hearing warned them of
the presence or approach of military.</p>

<p>“Do you see those lights ahead?”
queried Juan, at last.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Those lights come from the Inn of
the Red Cavalier. It is the inn where
Spanish officers dine when they return
from the interior well provided with
plunder taken from those who had yet
something left to lose. Judging by the
sounds, there are officers dining there
now.”</p>

<p>“A good place to keep away from,
eh?” queried Hal.</p>

<p>“By no means, senor. Keep close to
me, and I hope to show you that such
places as the inn are useful to the insurgents.”</p>

<p>Ramirez left the road, plunging into
the depths of a grove.</p>

<p>The nearer he came to the inn the
more slowly he moved.</p>

<p>Frequent bursts of laughter were now
audible from the inn.</p>

<p>“They are happy, the Spanish fiends,”
muttered Juan, grating his teeth. “Yet,
senor, they are feeding on the very blood
of Cuba!”</p>

<p>Rattle of dishes and clink of glasses
came to the ears of the listeners. Outside
the inn were tethered some two score of
horses, while soldiers lolled about over
the ground, some eating bread, while
others puffed at cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Twenty of our own brave Cuban fellows
could stop that gayety forever,”
growled Ramirez, savagely.</p>

<p>“But there are at least forty of the
enemy,” observed Hal.</p>

<p>“It is no matter. Twenty of our men
would do. But hush! There is the gleam
of a soldier’s musket&mdash;a sentinel. Senor,
do not make a sound that will betray
us.”</p>

<p>Forward, a foot at a time, moved the
pair, while not even a blade of grass rustled
under their feet.</p>

<p>So quietly did they move, in fact, that,
aided by the darkness and shadow of the
grove, they gained a spot within less than
thirty feet of the pacing sentinel.</p>

<p>Halting, Ramirez looked long and anxiously
at this uniformed son of Spain.</p>

<p>When the Cuban placed his mouth
close against our hero’s ear, it was to
whisper:</p>

<p>“Senor, that soldier is one whom I
know, for I have long had my eyes upon
him. If all goes well, we shall soon have
two guns. If I am deceived, our lives are
not worth a peseta. If you hesitate, go
back, and I will take the chance alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“Go back?” whispered Hal. “Not
when you go forward!”</p>

<p>Ramirez’s black eyes danced as he
nodded.</p>

<p>Then, craning his neck forward, he
whispered, sharply:</p>

<p>“Pedro! Pedro Escarillaz!”</p>

<p>In an instant, the sentinel halted, turning
his head.</p>

<p>“If money will do you any good,
Pedro Escarillaz, come here.”</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, the soldier’s rifle flew
to his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then, reconsidering, he walked slowly
toward the grove.</p>

<p>“Who called?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Men who have money,” answered
Juan. “If you happen to be hungry, you
will be glad that we have called you.”</p>

<p>Hal felt thunderstruck.</p>

<p>“Is this Cuban crazy?” he wondered,
hardly knowing whether to run or stand
his ground.</p>

<p>But the next second brought better
counsel.</p>

<p>Up to the present, Juan had proven
himself very far removed from a lunatic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Maynard felt cold shivers
running up and down his spine as he
realized that slight warning from this
sentinel would bring the whole Spanish
force down upon them.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” whispered the sentinel,
stopping squarely in front of them.</p>

<p>He held the muzzle aimed at them,
ready to fire at the slightest sign of need.</p>

<p>Yet that muzzle wavered slightly, as if
the Spaniard’s fingers, tightly gripping
stock and lock, were twitching.</p>

<p>“The Spaniard is more afraid than I
am,” muttered Hal, inwardly. “I guess
it’s the wrong time for me to get rattled.”</p>

<p>Though the talismanic word “money”
had brought the soldier a little off his
beat, it was plain that he feared some
surprise, for he not only gazed keenly at
his two accosters, but tried to peer over
their shoulders into the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>“You called me?” he demanded, in a
voice that could not have been heard
twenty feet off.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Juan, coolly. “We
need your services. We can pay for
them. Could you use money if you had
it?”</p>

<p>“Carramba!” muttered the fellow, his
eyes gleaming. “Could I not?”</p>

<p>“Very well, Pedro Escarillaz; we do
not want much&mdash;only two rifles and a
hundred cartridges.”</p>

<p>“Carr-r-r-r-rajo!” swore Pedro, under
his breath. “It is death to talk that
way.”</p>

<p>“Then you cannot serve us?” demanded
Juan, in a voice that sounded all
but indifferent.</p>

<p>“How much do you offer?” asked the
soldier, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars for a gun and cartridges?”
repeated Private Escarillaz.
“It is too little.”</p>

<p>“That would be altogether too much,”
retorted Ramirez, imperturbably. “The
price that I have offered must be for two
Mauser rifles and a hundred cartridges.”</p>

<p>“Say seventy-five dollars,” proposed
the soldier, “and I may be able to help
you. But for less it cannot be done.”</p>

<p>“Then, Pedro Escarillaz, I wish you
good-night,” answered Juan, performing
a half wheel.</p>

<p>“Not so quick,” uttered the soldier,
warningly. “Suppose I were to call the
guard? You would lose your money and
your lives.”</p>

<p>“True,” admitted Juan, composedly;
“but then your officers would get the
money, and you would get nothing. If
you make a trade with us&mdash;why, just
think what you could do with so much
money.”</p>

<p>“If I only knew how to accomplish
it,” murmured Pedro, his dark eyes snapping<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
at thought of the good times he
could have in Havana with so much
wealth.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Juan, calmly,
“if you cannot do it, we have made a
serious mistake, and you have been a
great loser.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” whispered Pedro. “In five
minutes the guard will be changed.”</p>

<p>“And then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will do my best.”</p>

<p>Hal and Juan ensconced themselves
behind some bushes. In ten minutes
Pedro Escarillaz returned, trembling and
pallid.</p>

<p>Almost in silence, the trade was made,
the traitor not daring to look into the
eyes of the purchasers.</p>

<p>Silently as shadows, the two latest
recruits for Cuba stole off in the night.</p>

<p>But Juan Ramirez seemed to have
grown a half a foot as he turned to his
American comrade, murmuring hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Now, mi amigo, for the long grass!
Henceforth our only cry shall be ‘Viva
Cuba Libre!’”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“AS GOMEZ WOULD SPEAK.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“It is your turn, mi amigo!”</p>

<p>“Ready!” responded Hal, rubbing his
eyes and then springing to his feet.</p>

<p>As he did so, he caught up the Mauser
rifle which had lain at his side as he
slept.</p>

<p>It was past sunrise. When he had lain
down, the earth was still wrapped in darkness.</p>

<p>There had been a bargain that he
should sleep an hour, then rise and stand
guard while Juan snatched an hour of
refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>Was it all a dream? Hal wondered, as
he surveyed the scene with alert eyes
while Juan had already commenced to
snore.</p>

<p>A dream it certainly was not. The
rifle with which each was provided was
a reality. So was the small Cuban flag
which Juan now wore proudly pinned to
his tattered jacket.</p>

<p>Havana was now many miles behind.
They were well up in the hills. Around
them all was verdure and bloom.</p>

<p>This bit of wild forest beauty had
escaped the devastating hand of the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>It was Easter morning, Hal remembered,
with a thrill. Surely, in this spot,
nature was doing floral honor to the day.</p>

<p>Not a sound was heard save the calling
of the birds, the buzzing of insects.
Perched on a rise of ground, screened by
thick bushes, a foe might have stood
within a hundred feet and not discovered
them.</p>

<p>“The only danger,” smiled Hal,
“would come from Juan’s snoring.”</p>

<p>Amid all this solitude of nature, however,
Juan’s nasal notes did not seem a
source of danger.</p>

<p>“Jupiter! What’s that?” muttered Hal,
suddenly.</p>

<p>From his perch he had an excellent
view up a long, winding ravine.</p>

<p>“The glint of the sun on steel, as sure
as I’m a sinner,” muttered the boy.</p>

<p>Turning, he gave Juan’s nearer
shoulder a quick shake.</p>

<p>“Ready, senor,” murmured the Cuban,
waking at once. “My hour is up, then?”</p>

<p>“No, but something else is up,” whispered
excited Hal, pointing up the
ravine. “Look there!”</p>

<p>Juan looked, and became instantly
awake.</p>

<p>“The enemy!” he muttered, his eyes
flashing ominously. “Heaven be thanked
that at last we have guns. We can
fight!”</p>

<p>“Fight that force?” demanded Hal,
aghast. “My friend, have you counted
their number?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“They number at least sixty.”</p>

<p>“No matter!” grated Juan. “We can
worry them. We shall be killed, of
course, but perhaps we can settle three
or four of their men first.”</p>

<p>“See here,” remonstrated Hal. “I’m
ready for fighting, but not for suicide.”</p>

<p>“It is the way we Cubans fight,” rejoined
Juan, proudly. “We care not what
the number of the enemy. We always
fire when we see one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fire, then, if you say so,”
agreed Hal. “If you asked my opinion,
though, I should say that we had better
wait until we have had a chance to offer
ourselves at the nearest Cuban camp.”</p>

<p>Juan fixed his wide open eyes on our
hero for an instant.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you are right, mi
amigo,” he said, an instant later. “Our
Cuban blood is too hot. We lack the cool
judgment of you Americanos. Senor, will
you take command?”</p>

<p>“Until we reach camp, if you wish it.”</p>

<p>“I beg you to do so.”</p>

<p>“Very well; though I warn you,”
smiled Hal, “that I shall not give the
order to attack thirty times our number.”</p>

<p>Juan sighed, but remained silent.</p>

<p>“They are going to march by within a
hundred feet of us,” whispered Hal, following
the course of the ravine.</p>

<p>Juan grasped his rifle tightly to still the
trembling of his fingers.</p>

<p>By this time, the head of the column
was within five hundred feet.</p>

<p>At the head rode a half a dozen
mounted Spanish officers.</p>

<p>Behind them marched a captain and
two lieutenants in command of the infantrymen.</p>

<p>Tattered and dusty-looking were these
soldiers. Many of them limped, as if used
up by a long forced march. Just at the
foot of the hill from which Hal and Juan
glared from covert, the captain, at a sign
from one of the mounted officers, cried:</p>

<p>“Halt!”</p>

<p>It was a popular order, as the relieved
faces of the men instantly showed.</p>

<p>“Break ranks.”</p>

<p>Arms were stacked, four sentinels
mounted, and the horses tethered.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, two dust-covered
troopers rode up the ravine from the
direction of Havana.</p>

<p>They dismounted before the captain,
talking with him in quick murmurs.</p>

<p>“My colonel,” called the captain,
saluting one of the mounted officers, “the
scouts tell me that there are none of the
enemy within forty miles.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe there are any rebels
nearer, captain,” laughed the colonel.
“So let your poor fellows get some of
the rest they need so badly. True, we
have no breakfast to offer them, but I
have caught sight of a stream through the
trees. Let those who would like to take
a swim.”</p>

<p>No proposition could have met with
greater favor. As with one accord, the
soldiers began to move off between the
trees, while the scouts cantered away.</p>

<p>“You four,” cried the captain, selecting
a quartette of his men, “will hurry
up with your swim, and return here to
relieve the sentinels, that they, too, may
have a plunge.”</p>

<p>With the men went their officers, nine
in number. The heat of the day made
cold water a luxury that could not be
resisted.</p>

<p>Down in the camp, with the horses
and stacked arms, remained only the four
sentinels.</p>

<p>Even these looked wistfully through
the trees as the shouts and plashing of
water came to their ears.</p>

<p>“Jupiter!” whispered Hal, his eyes
beginning to sparkle. “I’m beginning to
feel some of the Cuban hot blood myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>“If we could only capture that camp!”
murmured Juan, eagerly.</p>

<p>To his intense delight, Hal made this
whispered reply:</p>

<p>“By thunder, we’ll try it, if we go
under for it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my brave friend,” quivered Juan
Ramirez, “you have spoken as our brave
Gomez would speak!”</p>

<p>For a few moments the heads of the
two youths bobbed together in earnest,
whispered conversation.</p>

<p>When they had finished, Juan crept off
through the bushes with the stealth of an
Indian.</p>

<p>He reached a spot twenty feet away
from our hero before he halted and signaled
back.</p>

<p>Through the bushes the muzzle of
Hal’s rifle protruded.</p>

<p>As he aimed at one of the sentinels, a
curious thrill swept over the American.</p>

<p>He was about to take a life, and unfairly,
it seemed, since he must fire from
ambush upon an unsuspecting foe.</p>

<p>Yet, even as he hesitated, the remembrance
came back to him of the evening
before, when a Spanish officer had proposed
to send him over the fatal ferry to
Morro Castle.</p>

<p>The enemy would not hesitate; he
must not. Besides, war consists of killing;
war is gauged only by its successes.</p>

<p>With these thoughts surging through
his mind, Hal Maynard steadied both
hands and vision.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>His rifle spoke, and the sentinel at
whom he had aimed dropped and lay
still.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Juan had waited only for this signal.
Before the first sentinel had struck the
ground, the second had received his
death-wound.</p>

<p>Crack! crack!</p>

<p>Right on the heels of the first two
shots came the next pair.</p>

<p>Before the last two sentries had time to
turn, run or fire, they had met their
fates.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Hal was on his feet.
The fire of battle was in his blood; the
spirit of freedom possessed his soul as his
voice rang out full and clear!</p>

<p>“By platoon, battalion charge!”</p>

<p>An answering yell came from Ramirez
as that youth too leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>Together they rushed down the hill-side,
shouting commands to an imaginary
battalion.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p>Without stopping to aim, they fired
their repeating rifles through the trees as
fast as they could.</p>

<p>“Viva Cuba Libre!” they shouted in
unison.</p>

<p>Through the woods came the startled
yells of the bathing Spanish soldiers, just
out of range of vision.</p>

<p>Reaching the ravine, Hal made for one
stack of rifles, Juan for another.</p>

<p>Seizing each a rifle in either hand,
they commenced discharging them two at
a time in the direction of the creek.</p>

<p>“Al machete! al machete!” (To the
sword!) roared Juan, keeping up a thunderous
rattle of musketry.</p>

<p>“Surround the enemy!” thundered
Hal. “Give no quarter to Spaniards!
Every foe killed to-day is a foe the less
to meet to-morrow.”</p>

<p>All the while the incessant banging of
guns rang out.</p>

<p>To the startled bathers by the creek it
seemed as if they had fallen, naked and
unarmed, into fierce, one-sided battle.</p>

<p>“Keep a-banging and a-shouting,”
muttered Hal, as he sped by Juan.</p>

<p>Ramirez obeyed with a will, while
Hal, though he still continued to yell,
busied his hands by gathering up the
rifles an armful at a time.</p>

<p>There was rope around in plenty among
the camp baggage.</p>

<p>Working like a Trojan, Hal quickly<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
had thirty of the rifles lashed upon two
of the horses.</p>

<p>Juan turned and saw with blazing eyes
what his comrade had accomplished.</p>

<p>“The Spaniards are running,” he
quivered. “If it were not so, we would
have them on our hands by this time.”</p>

<p>And he worked like a beaver to help
Hal lash the remaining arms upon other
horses.</p>

<p>There were many cartridge belts strewn
around. These, too, were lashed across
the saddles, as well as a few cases of ammunition.</p>

<p>“Here are four less of the enemy for
our men to deal with,” cried Juan,
spurning with his foot the body of one of
the four slain sentinels.</p>

<p>“It was a tremendous piece of cheek,”
blurted Hal, vaulting into one of the
saddles, and seizing the halters of two
led pack horses.</p>

<p>“The Spaniards must still be running,”
chuckled Juan.</p>

<p>“I imagine few of them stopped for
their clothes,” laughed Hal. “But
mount, my friend, mount! When the
enemy halt&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It will be a half an hour before they
do,” derided Ramirez. “Oh, mi amigo,
you were born a master of strategy. It
was magnificent&mdash;that charge of a battalion
of trees&mdash;that fusilade fired by four
hands!”</p>

<p>“Into saddle! forward!” urged Hal.
“It is our turn to laugh, now, but in
sixty seconds it may not be. When the
enemy discover the trick, rivers of blood
would not satisfy them!”</p>

<p>Smiling grimly, with a full realization
of the peril, Hal Maynard urged his
mount into a trot.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BATTLE IN EARNEST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Viva Cuba Libre!”</p>

<p>Ramirez shouted that stirring battle-cry
with the full strength of his lungs.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just glorious!” declared Hal,
turning his sparkling eyes upon his comrade.
“Two recruits, with six horses and
sixty rifles!”</p>

<p>“Our comrades&mdash;that is, our comrades-to-be&mdash;will
embrace us!” uttered Juan.</p>

<p>Click-clack! Hoofs rang out sharply
on the stony bed of the ravine.</p>

<p>“Even if they turn to follow, we are
leaving the Spaniards behind,” cried
Juan.</p>

<p>“Very likely; but what if we were to
encounter a second body of the enemy
here in this ravine? Our turn to laugh
would be over.”</p>

<p>That thought urged them to greater
speed. When the ravine narrowed, Hal,
with two of the led horses in tow, took
the lead, Ramirez following closely.</p>

<p>“Juan, my comrade!”</p>

<p>“Si, mi amigo!”</p>

<p>“We are coming out of the ravine.
There is a plain ahead.”</p>

<p>Three minutes more of hard trotting
brought them out into open country,
dotted here and there with small groves
of palms.</p>

<p>“Better halt,” advised Hal, reining
up.</p>

<p>Ramirez did the same, without questioning.</p>

<p>“Rope the horses abreast,” directed
Maynard. “You can ride on one side of
the line, I on the other. In that way we
can keep the brutes at a gallop, if
needed.”</p>

<p>Dismounting, they quickly accomplished
this task. Within two minutes
they were once more in saddle.</p>

<p>“You must be our guide,” suggested
Maynard, as he settled down in saddle.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
“Where shall we find the nearest Cuban
camp?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied the Cuban.
“I know where Major Alvaredo was the
day before yesterday, but&mdash;diablo!&mdash;the
Cubans are not likely to camp for two
hours in the same spot. All I can say, mi
amigo, is that we had better ride eastward,
trusting that we shall meet some
pacifico who can tell us the way more
particularly.”</p>

<p>“Forward, then!”</p>

<p>From a trot they broke into a gallop,
urging the pack horses on by liberal
lashing with ropes.</p>

<p>In two minutes more our friends had
covered over half a mile.</p>

<p>“I heard yells,” muttered Hal, looking
backward over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ramirez looked, too, then broke into
a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>Back on a hill, near the mouth of the
ravine, they saw a sight calculated to inspire
mirth.</p>

<p>Spanish soldiers, some of them nude
and many half-dressed, dotted the hill.</p>

<p>In the first fright of surprise, these men
had fled. Then, finding that none of their
number were killed, and that no foe pursued,
they had halted, turned about.</p>

<p>They had probably found their four
dead comrades, and must have divined,
from the absence of such footmarks as a
battalion would have made, that they had
been tricked.</p>

<p>So they had pursued until now they
had reached a spot whence they were
able to see the exact strength of the
attacking force.</p>

<p>Frantic shouts now rent the air, reaching
our young friends even at that distance.</p>

<p>In the lead of all the Spaniards, Hal
could make out the uniform of the Spanish
colonel.</p>

<p>“He seems mad,” observed Hal, quizzically.
“If those soldiers were close at
hand, unarmed though they are, they
would make things hot for us.”</p>

<p>Ramirez nodded, his face darkening.</p>

<p>“Mi amigo,” he suggested, tremulously,
“suppose we stop and give them
fight.”</p>

<p>“With these horses and all these guns
destined for the insurgents?” demanded
Hal. “My friend&mdash;nit! We have no
right to risk losing such splendid supplies.”</p>

<p>“At least,” begged Ramirez, “let us
halt and fire a half a dozen shots into
them.”</p>

<p>“Fire at unarmed men?” retorted Hal.
“Not while I’m here to stop it.”</p>

<p>“Mi amigo, you are right,” replied
Juan, with an air of self-reproach. “But
do not blame me. We have so much reason
to hate that uniform of Spain that we
cannot resist the temptation to fire upon
it wherever we see it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” nodded Hal.
“But my grievances against Spain are of
such recent date that I can wait for fair
fight.”</p>

<p>No attempt was made by the Spaniards
to pursue the pair across the plain. Such
a chase would have been futile, anyway,
for jaded men are no match for galloping
horses.</p>

<p>In another half hour the foe were left
five miles to the rear.</p>

<p>Our young friends, too, had come to
the end of the plain. Before them
stretched a gradual slope leading up into
the hills.</p>

<p>“I think we can halt to breathe our
horses,” proposed Hal. “What do you
say?”</p>

<p>Ramirez nodding, both threw themselves
out of saddle to stretch their legs.</p>

<p>“It’s odd that we haven’t met a single
passer-by,” commented Hal.</p>

<p>“What else would you expect?” demanded
the Cuban, shrugging his
shoulders. “Spain has burned down all
the country homes, and driven the people
into the cities. Even if pacificos had
the courage to remain out here in the
country, on what could they subsist?
There is not enough food out here to
feed a rat.”</p>

<p>“They would have almost as much to
eat here as in the cities,” remarked Maynard,
growing misty-eyed over the remembrance
of the thousands of starving
Cuban reconcentrados he had seen in
Havana. “But we must go on, Juan.
The more I think, the hotter my blood
becomes. I shall not be happy until I
stand under the Cuban flag.”</p>

<p>Ramirez stretched out his hand, grasping
our hero’s warmly.</p>

<p>“I can never forget, mi amigo,” he<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
murmured, huskily, “that it was you
who gave me the happiness of being able
to take to the long grass.”</p>

<p>Mounting again, Hal gave the signal
to go forward. Up the slope they moved
at a jogging gait, being compelled once
more to lead their pack horses.</p>

<p>Hal reached the highest land just in
advance of his comrade.</p>

<p>Like a flash Maynard wheeled about.</p>

<p>“Halt! Dismount! Don’t come to the
top,” he cried. “Tether your horses&mdash;so.
Follow me.”</p>

<p>Rifle in hand, Hal led the way, Ramirez
following without a word.</p>

<p>“Look down there,” cried Hal.</p>

<p>In a valley to the northward rested
a squad of Spanish cavalry men, some
twenty in number, and commanded by an
officer.</p>

<p>Ramirez looked, his eyes flashing with
hate.</p>

<p>The enemy were dismounted, with
horses tethered.</p>

<p>“We can fire now!” breathed the
Cuban. “Those men are armed.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” warned Hal. “Come here.
Now look down there.”</p>

<p>Down the southward slope of the hill,
less than half the distance away of the
dismounted cavalry was a sight that made
the Cuban’s blood boil still hotter.</p>

<p>Four pacificos, their hands bound and
roped together, were slowly ascending the
grade.</p>

<p>Ahead of them rode three Spanish
cavalrymen; behind the prisoners a like
number of guards.</p>

<p>“What do you say now?” quivered
Hal.</p>

<p>“The pacificos must be saved. They
are to be taken to Havana or shot. The
latter would be the most merciful fate.”</p>

<p>Ramirez spoke jerkily, at the same
time swinging his rifle into position.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” commanded Hal. “Those
fellows are coming this way. We can fire
straighter when they are nearer. If they
keep to their course, they will go by
within fifty feet of here.”</p>

<p>“You command,” grumbled Ramirez,
“but it is hard to wait.”</p>

<p>“It’s common sense,” declared the
American. “If we were to fire now, and
miss, the cavalry in the valley on the
other side of the hill could reach here before
the fight was over. We should be
killed, and all to no purpose.”</p>

<p>“You have a plan?” questioned Ramirez.</p>

<p>“Thunder, yes!”</p>

<p>“If it works as well as the other did
my patience will be rewarded.”</p>

<p>“Slip back to the horses. Get four
more rifles&mdash;loaded ones.”</p>

<p>Ramirez vanished, though it hardly
seemed as if he had gone, before he was
back again.</p>

<p>“Here they are, senor, and loaded.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now crouch down, after
placing two of the rifles at my side and
two by your own side. Whatever you do,
don’t fire until I give the word.”</p>

<p>Ramirez obeyed, though the suspense
made him tremble.</p>

<p>His eyes flashed like jewels as he saw
the four Cubans and their guard come
nearer.</p>

<p>“Surely they are near enough now to
open fire,” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>But Hal shook his head emphatically.
“No, no, my comrade! When we fire,
we must take no chance of missing. Now,
not another word, but you will hear me
whisper ‘fire’ when they are within a
hundred feet. You take the fellow in the
front rank on the extreme left.”</p>

<p>Juan protruded the muzzle of one of
his weapons through the bushes that
screened them from sight.</p>

<p>He shook so with impatience as to
make the bushes rattle.</p>

<p>“Steady,” whispered Hal.</p>

<p>Ramirez, by a tremendous effort at
patience, got a better grip on himself.</p>

<p>Nearer, still nearer, came the six
troopers and their captives.</p>

<p>Hal himself found it hard to restrain
the temptation to fire, though he held
himself in check to the last.</p>

<p>But at last the whispered word came:
“Fire!”</p>

<p>Two jets of flame shot out from the
bushes; two troopers reeled from saddle
and fell.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! Two more were down.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! A fifth trooper fell, all
within the space of five seconds.</p>

<p>Ramirez, firing with the deadly aim of
hatred, had brought down all three of his
men, but Hal missed at the third shot.</p>

<p>“Car-r-r-r-r-rajo!” vented the solitary<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
remaining trooper, wheeling and putting
spurs to his horse.</p>

<p>Crack! Ramirez fired again, bringing
this fellow down, too.</p>

<p>Hal darted to his feet and started down
the slope, Ramirez posting after him.</p>

<p>At the first sound of fire, the four
pacificos had thrown themselves to the
earth. Now they raised themselves, peering
eagerly at their rescuers.</p>

<p>“You are friends of Cuba?” panted
Hal.</p>

<p>A hot chorus in the affirmative answered
him.</p>

<p>“You will fight with us? There are
more foes near.”</p>

<p>“Si, si, si,” (yes, yes, yes) cried one
of the pacificos, while the other three
raised a tumultuous shout of:</p>

<p>“Viva Cuba libre!”</p>

<p>Hal and Juan instantly busied themselves
with freeing the quartette.</p>

<p>“Follow us to the top of the hill at
your best speed,” yelled Maynard.</p>

<p>He reached there ahead of the rescued
ones, faced them, and shoved into the
hands of each a rifle.</p>

<p>As these were repeating weapons, each
still contained several shots.</p>

<p>Below, on the other side of the hill, an
animated scene was going on.</p>

<p>The squad, a few moments before lolling
on the grass, had now sprung into
saddle.</p>

<p>Their officer was bawling himself
hoarse with his rapidly delivered orders.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the squad seemed
uncertain whether to flee or fight.</p>

<p>Hal kept his little force out of sight by
making them crouch behind the bushes.</p>

<p>“I have waited a year and more for
such a chance as this,” sobbed one of the
pacificos, kissing the barrel of his rifle,
and Hal, looking the emaciated wretches
over, had no doubt that they would fight
to the last breath.</p>

<p>Juan slipped back to where the horses
were tethered, returning with more cartridges.</p>

<p>Hal, in the meantime, had restrained
the others from firing.</p>

<p>“It would do little good at this range,”
he explained, “and from what I have
heard the Cubans are not so rich in ammunition
that they can afford to waste
any.”</p>

<p>All the time he kept his eyes on the
squad below.</p>

<p>Their officer had decided upon an attack,
for at a quick command from him
the troopers spread out in skirmish line
and advanced.</p>

<p>Instantly the pacificos began to take
eager aim.</p>

<p>“Don’t fire yet,” ordered Hal.</p>

<p>“But senor,” pleaded one of the quartette,
“it is so hard to see the Spaniards,
and yet not fire!”</p>

<p>“The best fighters,” rejoined Hal,
promptly, “are those who can keep cool
and obey orders.”</p>

<p>“The senor is right, mi amigos,”
ejaculated Ramirez. “Twice he has restrained
my impatience, and in consequence
we won both times.”</p>

<p>Bang! A line of fire ran along the
skirmish line below, the reports sounding
as one.</p>

<p>Whish! whish! A tornado of whistling
bullets tore through the leaves of the
bushes that sheltered the little Cuban
force.</p>

<p>“Oh, mi amigo!” suddenly groaned
Ramirez, turning white.</p>

<p>For one of the bullets had struck Hal
Maynard.</p>

<p>Up flew his hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>In the next second he keeled back&mdash;stretched
out.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">UNDER CUBA’S FLAG.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Ten lives shall not pay for that one!”
exclaimed Juan.</p>

<p>But hardly were his words out when
Hal sat up, wiping away the blood from
his forehead.</p>

<p>“I’m a long ways from dead yet,” he
gritted, wiping away the blood.</p>

<p>Ramirez ran to his side.</p>

<p>His nervous fingers glided swiftly over
the American’s forehead, making quick
examination of the wound.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria be praised!” cheered the
Cuban. “The wound is not a deep one.”</p>

<p>“Glancing bullet, likely,” muttered
Hal, rising to his knees, and picking up
his rifle once more. “The shock knocked
me over, I suppose. Perhaps fright had
something to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Fright?” echoed Juan, indignantly.
“Nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m certainly feeling some
fright,” smiled Hal, his face more than
a trifle pallid as he took another look
down below at the squad trotting upward.</p>

<p>They were just aiming for another volley,
those Spaniards, who were now hardly
more than an eighth of a mile away.</p>

<p>“Down!” warned Maynard, himself
setting the example.</p>

<p>He had no more than ducked when the
volley came.</p>

<p>“Up!” quivered Hal. “Give ’em some
of their own medicine!”</p>

<p>Six shots rang out, almost simultaneously.
Two saddles were emptied.</p>

<p>“Keep a-pumping,” ordered Hal,
breathlessly, as he discharged his own
piece as fast as he could work the
mechanism.</p>

<p>His own wound had been caused undoubtedly
by a glancing bullet, but this
is the most painful kind of injury. It
maddened him, made him utterly reckless.</p>

<p>Five more saddles were quickly emptied
By this time the firing was general.</p>

<p>Clack! clack! clack! rang the hoofs.
The cavalry, firing at will like their opponents,
were now within a few yards of
the top of the hill.</p>

<p>The Cubans were overmatched. Hal
felt that the last few moments of his life
had come.</p>

<p>Yet only one thought actuated him.
Before he closed his eyes he would send
as many Spaniards as possible to their last
account.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! Half of the
Spaniards were out of the fight by the
time the two forces came face to face at
little more than arm’s length.</p>

<p>Bang! A ball from Juan Ramirez’s rifle
passed clean through the head of the
lieutenant in command, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>“No quarter!” yelled Juan as the six
leaped to their feet for hand-to-hand
combat.</p>

<p>“On the contrary!” thundered Hal.
“Any enemy who throws down his gun
must not be harmed!”</p>

<p>A ball from a cavalryman’s revolver
sent one of the pacificos staggering back&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>Hal immediately avenged by killing
the trooper.</p>

<p>Now one of the enemy threw down his
sabre and revolver, crying for quarter.</p>

<p>“Spare his life, then,” shouted Hal,
running forward.</p>

<p>That command acted like magic. Not
another shot was fired, for not one of the
eight surviving Spaniards lost a second in
surrendering.</p>

<p>This they followed up by dismounting
and submitting to being tied.</p>

<p>Ramirez, with blood running from a
wound in his left shoulder, superintended
the work of tying.</p>

<p>There were eight of the prisoners. As
soon as bound, they were ordered to remount,
and were next lashed to their
saddles.</p>

<p>“The dogs!” vented Juan, gnashing
his teeth as he looked the troopers over.
“Of course they surrender, for the Cubans
treat their prisoners of war kindly, and it
is easier to surrender than to be shot.
Besides, these fellows know that the
Cubans cannot be bothered long with
prisoners and that they will be set free.”</p>

<p>“This is horse fair day for us,”
laughed Hal. “Besides the horses which
the Spaniards ride, there are four more
below which appear to be uninjured.”</p>

<p>This was the fact. Hal’s little command
now had eighteen horses in all.</p>

<p>As soon as these had been corralled,
the field was gone over for every weapon
and cartridge that could be found.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes were thus consumed.</p>

<p>At last Hal had time to think of the
pacifico who had been killed.</p>

<p>He was dead beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>“My brother,” huskily murmured another
of the pacificos.</p>

<p>“He died nobly, in a good cause,” said
Hal, soothingly.</p>

<p>“He died for Cuba!” cried the dead
man’s brother, throwing back his head
proudly. “I shall pray to the Almighty
that I may die in the same splendid
way.”</p>

<p>Hal was ready to proceed, now, yet before
the start could be made there was
one sad duty to perform&mdash;the saddest that
belongs to war.</p>

<p>A shallow trench was dug, and in this
the man who had been slain was laid.</p>

<p>Then, while the rest stood by with uncovered<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
heads, murmuring silent prayers,
two of the pacificos covered the still form
over.</p>

<p>There was no time to bury the Spanish
slain.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Cubans, embittered by
more than three years of suffering under
the infamous war methods of Spain, were
in little mood to do anything decent by
the remains of the slain foe.</p>

<p>“The buzzards shall get them,” cried
Juan, disdainfully. “The buzzards alone,
in Cuba, do not go hungry!”</p>

<p>As Hal’s little command and considerable
train moved forward, our hero heard
the story of the pacificos.</p>

<p>Some fourteen months before they had
broken away from Havana. Since then
they had lived in hiding in the woods,
subsisting mainly on roots and fruit.</p>

<p>Once in a while they had received morsels
of meat from passing bodies of Cuban
soldiers.</p>

<p>But the law of the Republic of Cuba
forbade them to join the army without
weapons and ammunition, which was the
only reason they had remained pacificos.</p>

<p>That very morning they had been surprised
and surrounded while sleeping.</p>

<p>Incapable of resistance for lack of arms,
they had been forced to surrender.</p>

<p>They were on their way to Havana
when rescued. Had their journey been
finished they would undoubtedly have
been shot in the prison yard of either
Morro Castle or the Cabanas Fortress.</p>

<p>From these men Hal learned that the
Cuban commander, Major Alvaredo, was
supposed to be somewhere in the neighborhood,
though that officer’s exact location
could be only a matter of conjecture,
for the Cubans moved from point to point
with the speed of human lightning.</p>

<p>“I shall volunteer to the first Cuban
commander I meet&mdash;no matter who he
is,” declared Hal.</p>

<p>“Volunteer?” echoed Juan, smiling.
“It is too late for that, mi amigo! Judging
by the trail we have left behind, you
are already a full-fledged Cuban commander.
Never has so small a command
done handsomer work.”</p>

<p>At noon they halted, in the midst of
one of nature’s blooming wildernesses.
Here there had been no plantations, no
homes, hence the blighting hand of Spanish
devastation had not left its mark.</p>

<p>For the first time our hero remembered
the food with which Captain Blodgett had
provided Juan and himself the night before.</p>

<p>It was brought to light now, and given
entirely to the three late pacificos. They
devoured it like famished creatures.</p>

<p>“It seems as if I lived again,” declared
one of the poor, thin fellows, when he
had finished.</p>

<p>“It is like a touch of Heaven,” said
the second.</p>

<p>“The first real food I have touched in
weeks,” sighed the third. “With this in
my stomach I can fight for a week without
feeding.”</p>

<p>It was still dangerous to delay. Hal
gave the word to start.</p>

<p>It took an hour to cover the next five
miles, for the road was now all the way
up grade.</p>

<p>It was near the top of a hill that Hal
was startled by a sudden sharp command
of:</p>

<p>“Halt!”</p>

<p>In the same instant our hero found
himself looking into the muzzles of a
dozen rifles.</p>

<p>Yet the men behind those rifles were invisible
behind a dense tangle of green
foliage.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?” came the
quick question.</p>

<p>It was Juan Ramirez who answered:</p>

<p>“We seek Major Alvaredo.”</p>

<p>“And if he is not here?”</p>

<p>“Then any Cuban officer will do, for I
know you to be Cubans. Send word to
your commander, please, that five recruits
wait to offer themselves.”</p>

<p>“Major Alvaredo is here,” replied a
grave voice.</p>

<p>Through a screen of leaves came a
short, wiry-looking man of middle age, a
bronzed, scarred veteran who, despite his
ragged attire, looked every inch the
trooper.</p>

<p>One hand rested on the naked machete
that he wore dangling at his side; the
other hand touched lightly against a revolver.</p>

<p>“You are recruits?” he asked, keenly
surveying the five, then gazing with intense
pleasure upon the horses, weapons<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
and prisoners they brought him. “Judging
from appearances, you will be valuable
recruits. Where do you come from?”</p>

<p>Major Alvaredo listened with an interest
that soon changed to amazement as he
heard of the doings of the morning.</p>

<p>By the time that the narration was
over, he grasped our hero cordially by
the hand.</p>

<p>“You are ten times welcome, senor,”
he cried. “You want to see service
against Spain? Carramba! you shall see
it. And if I mistake not, senor Americano,
my general, Calixta Garcia, will
receive you as something more than a
private soldier. You have won a commission,
if ever man did in our armies.”</p>

<p>“If there is a commission going a-begging,”
smiled Hal, “it belongs to my
guide and mentor, Juan Ramirez.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that,” smiled the major,
“there may be commissions enough for
two.”</p>

<p>With that they were conducted into the
camp, where the major had about him
eighty of the most daring riders in Cuba.</p>

<p>Thus our hero had gained the Cuban
ranks. He was destined to become one of
the most famous fighters of them all.</p>

<p>That night Hal Maynard slept under
the flag of Free Cuba.</p>

<p>But he dreamed of the coming of the
Stars and Stripes!</p>

<p class="center p1">[THE END.]</p>

<p class="p1">Cuba is the scene of splendid deeds!
The struggle of her people for the
Heaven-born boon of independence has
commanded the whole world’s admiration,
just as the Starry Flag Weekly’s
series of Cuban war stories will win
the hearty applause of all American
readers. Hal Maynard and Juan Ramirez
played manly, dashing parts in that hot-blooded
struggle. What was perhaps their
greatest exploit of all will be thrillingly
told by Douglas Wells in “Gomez’s Yankee
Scout; or, The Blow that Told for
Cuba,” which will be published complete
in next week’s Starry Flag Weekly,
No. 2. This series will embrace by far
the best Cuban war stories that will be
Published!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center largefont boldfont">IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>

<p>It is the unchanging object of the publishers
of the STARRY FLAG WEEKLY to have the
best stories of adventure that can be procured,
regardless of expense or trouble. Following this
policy, the publishers decided some weeks ago to
send Mr. Douglas Wells to Cuba. Mr. Wells,
being an old campaigner, is accustomed to moving
on short notice. Within two hours of the receipt
of his orders he was speeding southward “under
light equipment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wells has spent many years of his eventful
life in the armed camps of the world. He has
spent many more years of his life in describing what
he has seen, in works ranging all the way from
history to romance. His long and varied experience,
powers of observation, and knowledge of
human nature have all greatly aided him in knowing
just what subjects to depict, therefore, on
reaching Havana he lost no time in getting to
work. In the face of many difficulties he succeeded
in obtaining permission to proceed into the
interior, and he was soon among the insurgents.
Then followed days of hard, rough riding, scant
sleep and poor and little food. He was received
by General Gomez, of the Cuban Army, and,
after witnessing much of the Cuban drilling and
some of the fighting made his way from the island
to Key West.</p>

<p>Should war take place between the United
States and Spain all his stories will be written from
the front. Readers of the STARRY FLAG
WEEKLY will have the most accurate and truthful
pictures of the war, and those who are familiar
with this author’s thrilling style will understand
that, while there may be other Cuban stories published,
none will be equal to those which will
appear in the STARRY FLAG WEEKLY.</p>

<p>Hal Maynard will be the hero, a bright, typical,
dashing American boy. As Napoleon once said
that every soldier of France carried in his knapsack
a marshal’s baton, so every American boy has implanted
in him the seeds of heroism, awaiting only
the sunshine of opportunity for development.</p>

<p>Thus Hal Maynard will be the representative of
all American boys, and our readers, in following
his adventures, will see done exactly what they
would do themselves were they in the hero’s
place.</p>

<p>Young Americans will do well to keep their
eyes on the STARRY FLAG WEEKLY. It will be
in these columns they will find the best and most
graphic stories of the war&mdash;stories that will be
written by an author who enjoys the somewhat
rare distinction of knowing what he is writing
about. Mr. Wells will not quit the front so long
as the fighting goes on. Who can describe so
well as he the march of great events this summer?</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
